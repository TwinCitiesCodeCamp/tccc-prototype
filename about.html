<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  Twin Cities Code Camp is Minnesota's largest free developer event. Each year,
  hundreds of Minnesota's best and brightest developers converge to speak,
  listen, and learn from one another. We're non-profit, the event is totally
  free, and as unpaid volunteers, we do it for the love of technology and the
  software craft. We hope you enjoy our event. Twin Cities Code Camp follows the
  guidelines published in the Code Camp manifesto. We expect our attendees to
  adhere to our code of conduct policy. As this is a community-driven event, we
  are always looking for people to lead sessions, volunteer to help during the
  day of the event, etc. If you'd like to participate, or if you'd like to
  contribute to the event, let us know.
