Megan has been a software developer for just over a year. She graduated with a degree from the University of Michigan in anthropology with minors in museum studies and Polish language, literature, and culture. Since graduation, her passion for data took her around the outskirts of development for several years, before she finally jumped into a bootcamp at Grand Circus in Detroit. She now serves as a co-founder and Executive Director for Tech-Inclusive, a non-profit organization to provide safe learning opportunities and networking events for minorities in tech and their allies. She works as a Software Engineer at Torrance Learning in Chelsea, Michigan.
