Software Development is my passion. I have 20 years of experience using Microsoft tools and technologies to develop software. I have experience in many roles including Development, Architecture, Infrastructure, Management, and Leadership roles.  I've worked for some of the largest companies in the world and for small local companies getting a breadth of experience in different Corporate Cultures. Currently, I am the Principal Cloud Architect at SafeNet Consulting, where I get to do what I love... Architect, Design, and Develop great software! I currently focus on Microservices, SOA, Azure, Cognitive Toolkit, and Kubernetes.
