I've been programming for over 25 years in Twin Cities. Now I get to do research and still keep my hand dirty with coding in many different computer languages.  Databases, networking, server-side, client-side, even mobile apps - I've dabbled and sweated over it.  In my off hours I write RPGs, screenplays, and review books.
