Hi there! My name's Adam, and I'm 13, but will be 14 when Code Camp rolls around. I'm an 8th grader at Richfield Middle School, and I'm rather funny and smart (at least I think so). I have been interested in coding and development for a while, and it's changed my life in some ways. TCCC21 is the first conference I've ever spoken at, or at least any big-ish event.
