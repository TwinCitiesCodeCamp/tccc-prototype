Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Erik. Iâ€™m a software developer living and working in Minneapolis as a full-stack developer working with the cloud. Iâ€™m the author of the Excalibur.js open source project. I love teaching, cooking, making games, and running long distances. And sometimes I can give a talk and chew bubble gum at the same time.
