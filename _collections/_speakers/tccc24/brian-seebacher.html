Brian Seebacher has worked as technologist since the first dot com boom in the late 1990's, when knowledge of basic HTML was a foot in the door to a field that was changing the world. Since then, he's built networks, web applications, services, databases, and analytics tools as part of his day job at Hargrove & Associates, Inc., where in 2014 he was named Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. 

In his spare time he manages a broomball team, tinkers with hobby electronics (poorly), plays video games with his 8 year old, and is the proud husband to a wife who is changing the world.
