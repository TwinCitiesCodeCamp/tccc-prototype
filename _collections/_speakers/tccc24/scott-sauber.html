I'm a software consultant at Lean TECHniques Inc. where I do web development using ASP.NET Core and JavaScript. My second dev passion behind web development is building DevOps pipelines and automating everything automatable. I co-organize the Iowa .NET User Group (iadnug.org) and I am a member of a couple .NET Foundation action groups (Technical Review and Speakers+Meetups). You can find me on Twitter @scottsauber or on my blog at scottsauber.com.
