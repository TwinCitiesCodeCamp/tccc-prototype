I'm a developer at Shreveport development shop Praeses, where I work as a project architect, developer, and recruiter. I work hard to deliver clean, extensible, and maintainable solutions to customers' business problems. I'm passionate about software as a profession and craft and work to cultivate that mindset in my team members through constant training. When I'm not writing code I'm advocating for LGBT equality.
