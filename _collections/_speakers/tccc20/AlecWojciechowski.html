Alec Wojciechowski is an experienced senior software developer, having worked at nearly a dozen different companies around the Twin Cities. Recently, he has had the pleasure of teaching complete newbies the craft of software development in a 12 week boot camp put on by The Software Guild in downtown Minneapolis. In addition, he takes new, passionate software developers in entry level roles and helps them reach their full potential. When he's not writing code or mentoring, he's probably somewhere above the Twin Cities in a Cessna 150.
