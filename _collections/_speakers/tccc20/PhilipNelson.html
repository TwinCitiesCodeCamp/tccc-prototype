Philip Nelson is the Research and Innovation Leader at Omni Resources as well as a full time developer and architect. He has worked with the internet since before there was a WWW and unfortunately is still attracted to shiny new things in tech. Devops and machine learning are high on the list of shiny things these days, but in the past he has been interested in agile methods, REST and hypermedia, object oriented programming, model driven development, object relational mapping, business process management, scalable architectures and a couple of others. Some of these worked out, and some not so much, and that just another topic to be interested in! When not coding, you may see him up on a stage playing a guitar around in Wisconsin, or out coaching kids in cross country skiing.
