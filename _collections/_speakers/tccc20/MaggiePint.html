Maggie Pint is the Web Development Manager at TempWorks Software. She spent the first several years of her career working as a SSRS developer and accidental DBA before converting into a full-stack ASP.NET developer. She currently specializes mostly in Angular JS, but there is a special place in her heart for bridging the gap between developers and DBAs. In her spare time, Maggie shows and breeds Australian Shepherds, hangs out with her three year old son, and engages in a constant battle of technical one-upmanship with her husband Joe â€“ also a .NET developer.
