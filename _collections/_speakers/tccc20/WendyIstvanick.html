I have been a developer with ThoughtWorks for over 20 years and have enjoyed solving technical problems and making people happy along the way. I also love to travel. So life as a consultant has been great, giving me many chances to enable solutions while living in places I never would have dreamed of living while growing up, including Brazil, France, and India.

In addition to coding on many projects I have had the opportunity to facilitate training both internal to ThoughtWorks and at client sites over the years thus being able to share my craft with others.
