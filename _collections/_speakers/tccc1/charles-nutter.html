    Charles Nutter has been a Java developer for the past decade and has also developed    using C/C++, Win32, and .NET. Most recently, however, Ruby has stolen his heart,    and he has spent the past two years helping the JRuby project achieve its performance    and compatibility goals. He joined Sun Microsystems in September 2006 and has since    worked fulltime on JRuby and other alternative language initiatives at the company.    Charles believes that all true developers will always want and need multiple languages,    and that language diversity is now a requirement for all VMs.<h3>    Links</h3><ul>    <li><a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a></li>    <li><a href="http://www.jruby.org">JRuby</a></li>    <li><a href="http://headius.blogspot.com">Personal Blog</a></li></ul>
