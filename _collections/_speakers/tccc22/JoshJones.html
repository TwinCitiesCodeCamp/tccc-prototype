I'm a senior software developer in the Midwest primarily writing mobile applications and web services.

In my spare time (when I'm not hopelessly addicted to Elder Scrolls Online) I like to experiment with various languages, micro-controllers, and new gadgets (like VR headsets). I also do some 3D Art and 3D Printing on the side.
