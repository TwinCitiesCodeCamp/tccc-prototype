I'm a full-stack web developer that has been working on DevOps as of late. Over the last year, I've lead the effort to port my company's application from AWS Elastic Beanstalk to Kubernetes. I work for a New York based startup, Contently, that I came to through via the acquisition of my startup, Docalytics.
