Nora and Eric are the key programmers from the Thunder PengWin Robotics FTC team.  We are 9th graders at Eagan High School.  We like to find ways to engage youth to learn about coding in a fun and interesting way.  We worked with our team to develop a Coder Dojo session using Robo Code.  It's a fun session and we wanted to share it with you.  We've had success using Robo Code to teach people entry-level Java programming.
