    <a href="http://nomadic-developer.com/" target="_blank">Aaron Erickson</a> is a    software developer/technology writer/agilist based out of Chicago, IL, where he    is a Lead Consultant for ThoughtWorks. His life's work is to help convert the human    intellectual capital into results for companies that empower both the knowledge    workers who produce software, and the people for whom that software is designed    to serve. He frequently speaks at events such as TechEd, DevTeach, VSLive, and .NET    user groups - with a goal of furthering the exchange of ideas - be they technology    contributions - or observations about the technology consulting business.<p>    He is a co-author of the upcoming book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-F-1-0-Ted-Neward/dp/047052801X" target="_blank">Professional F#</a>. He is also the author of the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nomadic-Developer-Surviving-Technology-Consulting/dp/0321606396" target="_blank">The Nomadic Developer</a>, a career guide for technology consultants.    In his spare time he likes to buy random ingredients at the store and have "iron    chef" night with his wife, play video games with his kids, and occasionally, log    on to World of Warcraft where he has a level 80 Rogue named EffSharper on the Bloodscalp    server.</p>
