    Dan Bennett is Senior Director, Online in the New Product Technology group of Thomson    Reuters responsible for development of online legal products. A serial developer    by night, Dan started messing with the iPhone SDK on launch, but then lost his iPod    touch dooming his plan to get the first Suduko app on to the app store. However,    all is not lost, as along with Jay, he has recently been building proof-of-concept    apps for Thomson Reuters content delivery to this device.<p>    Jay Peyer is a Senior Software Engineer within the KeyCite development group of    Thomson Reuters. A graduate of U.W. Madison, Jay has been developing software commercially    for 5 years. A Java developer by day, Jay finds himself attracted to the (somewhat    perverse) pleasures of Objective-C and has been learning and working in Cocoa alongside    Dan since the fall.</p>
