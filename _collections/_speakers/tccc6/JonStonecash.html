    Jon Stonecash is a senior consultant at Magenic, a Microsoft Gold Partner consulting    company. Jon Stonecash has worked in software development for much longer than he    would like to admit. In that time Jon has had the opportunity to make most of the    serious software development mistakes at least once. He has programmed in over a    dozen languages including several different assembly languages, Fortran, COBOL,    SNOBOL, classic Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#. He has survived the structured programming    revolution and the object-oriented. Jon's software development activities have included    the development of operating systems, scientific and engineering applications, and    enterprise systems. He has worked in every phase of software development from the    initial specification of requirements through to customer support. Along the way,    he picked up a BS in Mathematics and an MBA. He still has hopes of finding something    that he can be reasonably good at. His long term interests center about databases    and the aspects of the application that handle data access and business logic. He    is also interested in the tools and processes that assist the development process.
