<p>    The minimum? Why would I only want to do the minimum? It seems counter-intuitive    - the idea that the best path forward when embarking on new product development    should focus on the smallest possible product. Why not go big and try to launch    with a big splash? Won't your customers be turned off by a lack of features and    glorious complexity? As it turns out, taking the path of humility towards your market    is a far more productive path. You can start with a small hypothesis - test that    hypothesis against real customers. Using continuous delivery, you can rapidly iterating    over your product, using data, rather than opinion, to guide your product development    efforts. Such an approach not only costs less money, it allows you to vet the initiative    before it becomes "too big to fail". In this session, we will cover what the MVP    is, how you define one, and how you use validated learning to guide your efforts.    Further, we will cover how agile software development and continuous delivery are    essential to product development efforts that use this approach.</p>
