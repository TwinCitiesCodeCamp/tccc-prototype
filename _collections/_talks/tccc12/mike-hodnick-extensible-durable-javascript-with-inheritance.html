<p>    In this session we'll talk about your options to implement inheritance with the    squirmy, naughty, and very powerful language known as JavaScript. JavaScript has    moved far beyond tricks like manipulating an HTML DOM and is being used to build    powerful client-side (and server-side) libraries. As these libraries become more    complex, inheritance can play a major role in how these libraries are implemented,    consumed, and customized. With JavaScript's dynamic nature there is more than one    approach you can take to achieve inheritance. Some of these approaches have performance    implications, while others are more a matter of taste and style. In this session    we'll discuss these approaches and which ones are best for different scenarios.</p>
