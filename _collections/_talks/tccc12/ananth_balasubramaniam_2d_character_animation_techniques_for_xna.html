<p>    As the trend of cutesy, fluidly animated 2D characters with a cartoon twist continues    in the world of mobile games, developers need to come to grips with the technologies    used by the pros to create and render this sort of game content. This session will    take a deep-dive into the world of creating fantastic, realistic 2D characters/animations    using simple sketches and freely available tools. We'll also see how to efficiently    and flexibly render complex characters using WP7+XNA (Reach profile), touching upon    topics like animation blending, artist-driven inverse kinematics and integration    with physics engines like Farseer.</p>
