<p>    The war's over. Web plugins like Silverlight and Flash have served their purpose    well, but the native web is now sufficiently powerful to render web plugins superfluous    and irrelevant. What's a Silverlight developer to do? Enter KnockoutJS. Instead    of throwing away our existing skills built up through Silverlight, I'll show you    how to transfer your skills to the native web via KnockoutJS, using familiar technologies    like data binding, MVVM, templates, and commanding support.</p>
