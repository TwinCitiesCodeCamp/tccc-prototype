<p>    The ability to communicate requirements via executable specifications is moving    from bleeding edge to leading edge as team's are seeing it's value for both their    agile processes as well as their continuous delivery pipeline. This talk will demonstrate    testing a system's behavior using JBehave - a pure-Java BDD/ATDD tool with a syntax    similar to Cucumber's Gherkin. We will cover basic stuff up to and including Selenium    testing with Page Objects.</p>
