<p>    With the announcement from Microsoft that KnockoutJS would ship as an integrated    part of MVC 4.0, KO is receiving a great deal of interest from the web development    community. This talk will take you through a ground up implementation of Knockout    2.0 including observables and data-bindings. In addition, the presentation will    cover some of the mistakes and pit falls common to first time users and will showcase    a couple of advanced features such as custom bindings that can be used to overcome    them.</p>
