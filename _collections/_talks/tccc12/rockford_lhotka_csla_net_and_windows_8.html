<p>    Windows 8 offers the exciting new “Windows Runtime (WInRT)” platform for application    development. This new platform is similar to Silverlight in many ways, though it    also supports JavaScript and C++ technologies in addition to .NET. CSLA .NET is    a widely used open source framework for building reusable business logic in .NET    that can run on .NET, Silverlight, Windows Phone, and Android. In this talk you    will learn how CSLA .NET is being enhanced to support the new WinRT platform as    well, allowing you to take your existing CSLA-based business logic and simply recompile    it for use in building WinRT applications.</p>
