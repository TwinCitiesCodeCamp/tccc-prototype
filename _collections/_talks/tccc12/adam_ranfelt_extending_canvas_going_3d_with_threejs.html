<p>    We will be moving past the basics of the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element and use the    growing 3D library three.js. After going over the limitations and allowances available    to the library, we will go over setting up a scene, the mesh model, primitive geometries,    basic lighting, interaction, and go over tools to help you in your implementation.    This presentation will cover the library being used for WebGL, though we will also    cover the other available renderers.</p>
