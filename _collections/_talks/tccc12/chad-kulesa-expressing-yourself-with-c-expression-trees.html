<p>    Expression trees provide many new options for creating reusable code. Understanding    expression trees will allow you to extend LINQ providers or even write your own    LINQ provider. You can also write your own fluent API, removing the need for configuration    or XML files. It is even possible to turn C# statements into Javascript! We will    begin the journey of mastering expression trees, and adding this important skill    to your repertoire.</p>
