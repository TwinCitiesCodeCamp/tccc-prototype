<p>    Unit testing is a core part of a developers job, and is an important part of software    quality. All too many times though, Javascript is left out of the unit testing mix.    Learn how to architect your Javascript to make it more testable, and also how to    use unit testing frameworks to mock your AJAX calls, create repeatable unit tests,    and integrate those unit tests with a continuous integration server.</p>
