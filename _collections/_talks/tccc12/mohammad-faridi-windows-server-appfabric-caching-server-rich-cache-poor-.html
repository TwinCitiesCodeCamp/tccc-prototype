<p>    The what, and how of Windows Server AppFabric caching 1.1. In this talk we will    work with AppFabric Caching, getting it set up, how to place items in the cache,    retrieve them, etc. We will talk about using Powershell to create cache, and monitor    it. We will also talk about the pros and cons of configuration of the AppFabric    Cache service. If we have time we might go over differences b/w Azure Cache and    Windows Server Cache.</p>
