<p>    Have you ever had that dream, where you're coding away, and a team mate asks you    to "mail them that 1 stored proc", so you do, then they come back and say "that    broke my local DB's schema!!". And then you wake up only to realize.... IT WASN'T    A DREAM!?! Science tells us that less than 8.268% of Dev Teams use source control    for their database. That's crazy talk! How do you people sleep at night?! Come see    some fresh techniques using tools by Microsoft and Redgate to tame the savage data    beast. We'll explore getting schemas and data into your favorite source control    repository, complete with change history and merge resolution. The Tour de Force    will be leveraging these tools into a Continuous Integration AND Deployment process,    complete with auotmated Test Data Generation and Integration Tests. Then sleep well    at night knowing all your data babies are snuggled in and safe.</p>
