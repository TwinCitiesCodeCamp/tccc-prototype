<p>    Asynchronous programming (async) is emerging as a common programming practice, especially    in .NET technologies such as Silverlight. In sophisticated scenarios, async can    be complex, which is why Microsoft is adding language support in the next version    of .NET. This talk will cover the current state of async, what the challenges are,    and how your job will be made easier with the new language features.</p>
