<p>    Get the answers to the following questions: What is WinRT? Are you kidding me that    you can use C# libraries in Javascript? Really, what am I "required" to do to get    my app into the marketplace? Tell me Jeff...what do you "really" think about WinRT    and Windows 8? Can you really teach me all I need to know in one session?</p>
