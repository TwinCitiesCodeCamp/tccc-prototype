<p>    Right now, there's a focus on creating native applications for mobile devices, but    that can be costly, require a lot of additional time, and may be overkill for what    you're doing. By combining the flexibility of Ruby on Rails with the ease of use    of jQuery Mobile, you can develop quality mobile web apps. In this talk, we'll walk    through creating a simple app, from scratch, that presents both a desktop and mobile    view, and we'll talk about the ups and downs of this approach. Best of all, no prior    knowledge of Ruby on Rails is assumed, and you'll have all the source code you need    to recreate this project on your own.</p>
