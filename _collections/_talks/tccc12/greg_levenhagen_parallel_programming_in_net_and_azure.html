<p>    Parallel programming remains a difficult task, but the .NET framework keeps making    things easier for developers. With the various constructs available, like the addition    of the Task Parallel Library in .NET 4, it is important to know what is appropriate    for different situations. Devices continue to gain cores and the cloud offers easily    distributed computing, so developers should understand how to utilize the environments.    Come for a walk-through of how and when to use these constructs, whether that is    in the cloud, a mobile device, desktop application or the web.</p>
