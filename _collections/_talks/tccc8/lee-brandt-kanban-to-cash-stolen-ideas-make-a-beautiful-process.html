<p>    This is an "Open Kimono" type discussion about the process I've been using/adapting    for the last few years. We take the Kanban ideas of Limited WIP and cumulative flow    diagrams and add Arlo Belshee's Naked Planning, modified a very little for integrating    with TDD/BDD and meld some XP practices and Agile practices together to make a development    process that is easy to do and easy to change as we feel friction.</p>
