<p>    Anyone that has followed Silverlight in recent months has probably heard that RIA    Services is "game changing." Admittedly, it is pretty cool, but what if you want    to go past the slap-it-together demos everyone is doing on the Internet? What if    I want to tailor RIA Services for my specific needs? How do I minimize my data traffic    to keep my cloud computing costs as low as possible?</p><p>    In this session we will look under the hood for RIA Services and explore how to    manually manipulate RIA Services from code. How do I force one row in my RIA Services    bound datagrid to update, without refreshing the whole page? Where is the RIA Services    cache inside my Silverlight application? How can I access it, what if I want to    remove something from the cache? How can I control filtering from my code? How do    I implement security into my RIA Services? This session will cover these topics    and more.</p>
