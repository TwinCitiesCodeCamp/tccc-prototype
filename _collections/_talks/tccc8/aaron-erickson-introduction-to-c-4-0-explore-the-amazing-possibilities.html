<p>    Come to this introductory talk where we take a look at a new CLR 4.0 feature that    is likely to significantly change the way we code in C#.</p><p>    Do you remember when generics were introduced in the .NET runtime 2.0? That was    the the biggest new feature in that version of the framework and it's almost 5 years    old. Time for a new runtime release with new and exciting features.</p><p>    In this talk, we focus on the only new feature in C# 4 that really matters â€” the    dynamic keyword. There are some new, amazing possibilities that, previously, were    only elegantly achievable with dynamic languages like JavaScript and Ruby. We will    touch on ways that using dynamic can change the way that you code, including things    like a true ActiveRecord pattern, Expando objects, and more.</p>
