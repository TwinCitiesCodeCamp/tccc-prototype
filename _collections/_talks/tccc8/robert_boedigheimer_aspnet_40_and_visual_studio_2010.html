<p>    Are you ready for another version of ASP.NET and Visual Studio? ASP.NET 4 provides    some major additions to AJAX with greater client support in the way of templates    and the DataView control for data binding. It also remedies several issues that    have existed since version 1.0, including control naming and controls that render    more standard compliant HTML. Dyanamic Data also has changes to make its features    available to all ASP.NET web sites. This release also focuses on easing deployment    issues with web packages and the ability to transform web.config files for deploying    to production servers.</p>
