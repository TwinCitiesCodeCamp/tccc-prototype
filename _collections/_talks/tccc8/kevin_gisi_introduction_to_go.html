<p>    Go is a brand-spanking-new systems language that Google released in November, 2009.    Every wonder how awesome C would be if it was garbage-collected, concurrent, and    didn't take a few weeks to compile? Wake up; it's here! We'll take a look at this    new language that steals some of the dynamic flexibility of Python and Ruby, the    performance of C, and a compile time that you'll miss if you blink.</p>
