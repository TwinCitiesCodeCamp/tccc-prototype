<p>    Subsonic is an elegant Active Record implementation for the .Net Framework that    can save you significant development time. It uses a powerful query engine to pull    data into well designed generic collections. At the end of the day you can use more    energy in the design of your pages and their business logic since your focus is    not on building yet another data access layer. I'll walk you through how to get    started with SubSonic to get the most out of the tool, show you how to go beyond    the basics and will demonstrate how to rapidly build out a web site.</p>
