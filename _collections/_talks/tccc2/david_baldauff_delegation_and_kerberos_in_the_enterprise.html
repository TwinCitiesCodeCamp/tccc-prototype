<p>    This presentation will describe Kerberos at a high level, and then go into detail    on how to setup Delegation and Kerberos authentication using SQL Server, IIS and    a client. Additionally we may delve into delegation across two SQL instances and    a client. The presentation will include a review of the tools necessary to setup    delegation and Kerberos and the debugging techniques used to resolve Kerberos authentication    problems. If you are looking for a way to improve your security, eliminate the need    for SQL authentication and understand the tools needed to do this, then this presentation    is for you. If you know what a double-hop is and could never quite find a way around    the problem before, then this presentation is for you. And, if you ever wondered    how to get a client app authenticated through IIS to SQL server and maintain auditing,    then this presentation is for you.</p>
