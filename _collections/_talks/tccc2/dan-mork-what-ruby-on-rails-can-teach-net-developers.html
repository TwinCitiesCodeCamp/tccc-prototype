<p>    Ask a Rails developer how she would tackle a simple business problem. She'll tell    you. Put your database scripts here, your functional tests here, html markup here,    controller logic here, your unit tests here, and put your model here. To validate    your model, add a few lines here. And because of some simple and reasonable naming    conventions, it all plays well together. Ask a .Net developer how to tackle the    same business problem. She'll start thinking. Well, the UI seems pretty obvious,    but from there it gets difficult. You might start by doing the "simplest thing that    can possibly work," and drag a dataset onto your screen. But where do you put your    database scripts? And how do you test your business logic? Or your UI controller    logic? And how do you name things? If this developer has been around for a while,    she probably has a few favorite patterns in her toolbox. Maybe she's even got some    of the pieces covered with reusable code libraries. But she doesn't have a solid,    well-tested, common framework for completing even a simple business scenario. She    should! In this presentation, we'll describe how Rails removes many of the common    barriers to getting real work done â€“ and discuss how the .Net community might do    the same.</p>
