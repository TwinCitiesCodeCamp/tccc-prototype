<p>    Do you think that Windows Desktop Search (WDS) is just about finding that long-lost    spreadsheet? See how to integrate search features into your own applications to    provide more power to your users. Take advantage of the search index to see files    and other entities in a whole new light with less effort than you might imagine.    You may never use the file open dialog again!</p>
