<p>    Many Windows developers have used Visual SourceSafe their entire career. Most of    us know there are other source code control tools out there but have never had any    exposure to them. In this session I will introduce Subversion, a free, open source    version control system. First we will take a look at what tools are available for    use with Subversion (command line, TortoiseSVN, AnkhSVN). Next we will cover some    basic concepts about versioning models and Subversion's implementation and then    walk though how a developer works with Subversion on a daily basis. After looking    at daily developer usage we will dive into some more advanced topics Subversion    administrators will need to understand and power users will want to know about including    branching, merging, creating and applying patches, repository setup and structuring,    and integration with issue tracking systems.</p>
