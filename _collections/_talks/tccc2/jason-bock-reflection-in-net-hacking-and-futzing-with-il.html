<p>    Reflection is a powerful way to dynamically inspect assembies at run-time to determine    the structure of its contents, invoke methods, and change private field values (among    other interesting tricks). But it doesn't stop there - .NET gives you the power    to create code at run-time via its reflection infrastructure as well. In this presentation,    I'll cover the essentials of the System.Reflection namespace (along with the changes    that were added in 2.0), how to emit code at run-time, and other libraries that    go far beyond what .NET can currently provide (FxCop's CCI library for introspection    and Mono.Cecil for full assembly reading/writing).</p>
