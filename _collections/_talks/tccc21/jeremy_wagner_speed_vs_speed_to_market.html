We all agree that performance is important, but in our zeal to be first to market, we don’t realize that performance problems exist until a site is already in production. This talk is intended to arm developers and other technically-inclined professionals with knowledge that will help them be proactive in addressing this difficult problem. In this session, you’ll learn about:

- Evoking genuine concern for performance by helping your colleagues identify your site’s target audience, and identify that audience’s capabilities by using data from Akamai’s State of the Internet connectivity report.

- How to use this newly-acquired information in concert with automated testing tools to approximate what key performance metrics will be for your users.

- Spring into action by automating optimization tasks with Node and gulp, so that you’ll be optimizing as you develop, instead of after the fact.

- Some techniques for achieving quick performance wins for troublesome sites already in production, such as resource hints, PostCSS and more.
