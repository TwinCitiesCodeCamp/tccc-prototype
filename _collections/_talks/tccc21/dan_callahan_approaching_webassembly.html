WebAssembly is a new low-level, high-performance alternative to JavaScript on the Web. As an open standard developed by Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, WebAssembly will eventually run everywhere that JavaScript does: in every major Web browser, and in runtimes like Node.js and Electron which are derived from those browsers.

After three years of research and experimentation, WebAssembly is finally real. The specification has stabilized, and the first implementation debuted with Firefox 52 on March 7th, and in Chrome shortly thereafter.

This talk examines WebAssembly from a practical standpoint, answering what it is, why it was created, how it works, and how you can use it today.
