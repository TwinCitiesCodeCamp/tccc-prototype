An overview of advanced Async/Await topics. Async/await is great and easy!! Unit it's not. This will be a walk thru of the areas where Async/Await can be difficult and how to deal with them. Topics include: System.Task, exception handling, avoid void Async, unit testing including Moq, async constructors (or lack thereof), deadlocks and ContinueWith, Reactive Extensions and synchronization context. The focus will be on code examples and research resources.
