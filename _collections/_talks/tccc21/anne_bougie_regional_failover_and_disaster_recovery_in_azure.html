In recent years there have been instances where the Internet is not available across broad geographical regions. One of the benefits of moving to the cloud is being able to utilize geo-redundancy for disaster recovery. Azure has a bewildering array of tools and services available, but the devil is in the details, and using the wrong tool for the job could be, well, disastrous. This session will cover the services and their trade-offs. We will demonstrate a working example of a coordinated solution that gracefully fails over with minimal disruption to the end user.
