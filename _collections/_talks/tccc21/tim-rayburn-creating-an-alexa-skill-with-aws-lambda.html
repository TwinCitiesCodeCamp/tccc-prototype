Amazon's Alexa platform is taking the world by storm, helping empower smart homes around the world.  But what many developers may not realize is that this is not a closed platform, in fact it has a thriving marketplace for programs, or Skills as Amazon calls them.  This talk will walk you through the process of creating a simple Skill for Alexa, and deploying into AWS Lambda.  Working copies of the code base will be provided (via GitHub repo) so that attendees should be able to have a skill of their own deployed by the end of the session, which they can then enhance to their heart's content.
