We all use SQL Server every day in our jobs, so it pays to know what SQL Server can do for us that will make our jobs easier.  This talk will introduce you to some key features of SQL Server that you might not know about but will definitely want to use once you learn about them.  First, we’ll discuss temporal tables, which provide a convenient way to track all of the changes made to data in a table.  Second, we’ll talk about the JSON support built into SQL Server 2016 and what capabilities it provides us.  Third, we’ll cover some advanced SQL constructs like the MERGE statement and Common Table Expressions that can make the SQL you write simpler.  And finally, we’ll wrap up by talking about the windowing functions in SQL Server, which provide powerful analytic capabilities to our SQL Statements.

After this talk, you will better appreciate some of the rich functionality built into SQL Server and understand how to use these capabilities to make your job easier.
