Tabs. Spaces. Such simple things, yet the epic wars that have been raged around these characters in developer circles have been tumultuous. Countless hours have been wasted in code reviews debating who is right and wrong. Teams have been torn asunder. Trolling has reached internet-crashing proportions. But the question remains: which one is better?

In this session, we'll cut through the hyperbole and emotions and get down to business. We'll see how compilers work with code, and how tests are set up to yield hard facts on performance and memory usage. We'll use this information to make rationale judgements for our coding standards. Come to this session with a sense of humor, and leave with insight into code analysis, automation, and decision making.
