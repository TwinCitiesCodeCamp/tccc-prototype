<p>    Is Workflow Foundation going to be the ugly-haired step-child in the . Net Foundations    touted threesome of WCF, WPF, and WF? Only time will tell. We'll give it a walk    around the block by taking a look at the two workflow structures: sequential and    state machine. We will also highlight these features specifically: Branching Activities,    Policy Activity, Workflow Persistence, and passing data into and out of the workflow.</p>
