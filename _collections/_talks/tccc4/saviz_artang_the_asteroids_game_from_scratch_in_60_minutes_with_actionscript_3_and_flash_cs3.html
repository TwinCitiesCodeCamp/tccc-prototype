<p>    I'll create the Asteroid's game from scratch in 60 minutes. No ActionScript experience    required. If you've coded before you can follow along and see how easy it is to    make web based games in the recently released OO based ActionScript 3 and Flash    CS3.</p><p>    <a href="http://savizartang.com/codecamp2008">Presentation Material</a></p>
