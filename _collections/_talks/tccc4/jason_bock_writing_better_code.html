<p>    It's one thing to write code that will do the job in the short-term; it's another    challenge to write code that can stand the test of time. In this session I'll show    you how you can use tools and features in VS 2008 (e.g. unit testing, Code Analysis,    Code Coverage, etc.) to assist you in making your code maintainable over time, easy    to understand, and resilient to defects.</p><p>    <a href="http://www.jasonbock.net/JB/Code/WritingBetterCode.zip">Presentation Material</a></p>
