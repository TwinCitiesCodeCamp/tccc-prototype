<p>    Since it's release with SQL 2000, Report Services has provided an easy and scalable    solution for providing end users with a view into their data. Taking advantage of    a structured RDL model, developers can design and deploy reports quickly to a variety    of formats. In this session we look at what's new in SSRS 2008 from architecture    to design to deployment and how developers can take advantage of these great new    features.</p>
