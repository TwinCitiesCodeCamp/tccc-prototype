<p>    Microsoft recently released a Community Technology Preview (CTP) of the Parallel    Extensions to the .NET Framework, a managed programming model for data parallelism,    task parallelism, and coordination on parallel hardware unified by a common work    scheduler. Parallel Extensions provides library based support for introducing concurrency    into applications written with any .NET language, including but not limited to C#    and Visual Basic. In this talk, Jeff will provide an oveview of this exciting new    breakthrough in muti-core processing using the .NET framework and will walk through    code samples illustrating the technology.</p><p>    <a href="http://cid-7062094a08532907.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Twin%20Cities%20Code%20Camp%20IV">Presentation Material</a></p>
