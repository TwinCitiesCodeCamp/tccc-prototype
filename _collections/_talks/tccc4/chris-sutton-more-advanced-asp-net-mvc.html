<p>    So you've worked with the basics of ASP.Net MVC and you are ready to delve into    more advanced topics. Chris will give quick overview of the ASP.Net MVC framework    and why it is important. Then we will jump right in to integrating the jQuery javascript    library with ASP.Net MVC. We'll show how to do partial postbacks and how to make    use of other advanced jQuery capabilities and effects. One of the benefits of ASP.Net    MVC is that unit testing your page actions becomes much easier than in the current    ASP.Net model. So we'll look a look at the basics of unit testing your MVC sites.    Last, we'll talk about MVC deployment issues you may run into with IIS and how you    can work around them.</p>
