<p>    Language Integrated Query (LINQ) is one of the most important new features of the    .NET Framework. It has the potential of affecting just about every area of the software    we write, from the data access layer all the way up to the UI. In this session we    will take a top-to-bottom look at LINQ. We will understand where it came from, how    it works, and, most importantly, how we can tap its full potential in our daily    coding life. I will include examples on LINQ to Objects, LINQ to SQL, and LINQ to    XML.</p><p>    <a href="http://www.twistedstream.com/stuff/pete/Tapping-the-Power-of-LINQ.zip">Presentation Material</a></p>
