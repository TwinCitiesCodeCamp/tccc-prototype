<p>    This presentation will discuss several facets of the Model View Presenter architecture    including the following.</p><ul>    <li>Where it came from</li>    <li>What is it?</li>    <li>Why use it? What's the value of this approach?</li>    <li>        "Blind Databinding" how to use databinding when the view knows nothing about the        model    </li>    <li>Implementation</li></ul><p>    I will demonstrate how to implement a Model View Presenter based application using    the Microsoft.NET 2.0 framework. In this demonstration I will show the value of    separating the user interface code into what is known within the MVP as a Presenter.    I will also demonstrate how you can utilize this approach to automate user interface    testing with NUnit. Finally I will provide a short discussion on where this architecture    is heading with the new "Supervising Controller" and "Passive View".</p>
