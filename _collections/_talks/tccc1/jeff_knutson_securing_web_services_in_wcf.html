<p>    <a href="JeffKnutson.zip">Content</a></p><p>    You're a developer, you <b>love</b> security, right? No one can read your XML messages    or tamper with their contents, right? Ok, I know many developers hate security because    it's "hard" and it "gets in the way" of getting their already late projects done    on time. Security is here to stay whether you like it or not! The good news for    web service developers is that the WCF team has put a great deal of work baking    security into the framework so you don't have to be a security expert to "get security    right". This talk will demonstrate techniques in WCF that all of us overworked and    underpaid developers can use to spend less time securing and more time building    the web service.</p>
