<p>    <a href="NeilIversen.zip">Content</a></p><p>    Looking at whether you should use SharePoint? Already decided to but now you have    to code for it? This presentation will help you get off to a great start. SharePoint    is a lot bigger than documents and lists and this presentation will be an introduction    to developing against it. We'll cover the object model by creating a web part, using    the web services from a Windows form app and how to use RPC to perform actions that    the web services don.t support. We'll also discuss how to take advantage of the    relationship between SharePoint and ASP.net.</p>
