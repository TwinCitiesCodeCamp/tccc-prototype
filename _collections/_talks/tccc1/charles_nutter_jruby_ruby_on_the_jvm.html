<p>    <a href="CharlesNutter.odp">Content</a></p><p>    The Ruby language has turned the corner and started to explode into mainstream development.    There are now over seven implementations of Ruby for all the major VMs and several    other platforms. JRuby is a 100% Java implementation of Ruby targetting the JVM,    designed to enable Java developers to use Ruby as a first-class language and also    to enable Ruby developers a powerful drop-in replacement for the standard C-based    interpreter. JRuby has made great progress toward matching Ruby in compatibility    and performance, and already can run popular applications like Rails. This session    will give an introduction to JRuby, JRuby on Rails, and what the future holds for    Ruby on the JVM.</p>
