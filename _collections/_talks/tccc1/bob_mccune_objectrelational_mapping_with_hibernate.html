<p>    <a href="http://bobmccune.com/?p=10">Content</a></p><p>    Hibernate has become one of the most popular Java persistence frameworks due to    its ease of use, performance, and ability to transparently bridge the object/relational    gap. It allows you to develop rich, fine-grained domain models that leverage the    standard object-oriented idioms of inheritance, polymorphism, association, and composition    without the challenges associated with handling the low-level persistence details.    This session will explore the framework's core features by providing examples of    how to effectively implement Hibernate in your applications.</p>
