<p>    Seemingly overnight, Ajax has gone from an obscure acronym to, well, having conferences    devoted to it. People are often surprised when they learn that Ajax isn't really    anything new - so if it's yesterday's technology, why all the hype? This talk will    examine the course of events that led up to the current love affair with richer    client applications. We'll talk examine the technologies that power an Ajax application    and discuss how to work with them - and then we'll examine a number of frameworks    that will do much of the heavy lifting for us!</p><p>    Once we understand the techniques of Ajax, we'll touch on where (and where not)    it's appropriate for your application finishing off with some common gotchas.</p>
