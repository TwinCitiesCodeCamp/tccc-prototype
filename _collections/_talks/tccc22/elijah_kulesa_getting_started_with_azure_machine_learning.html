This is a gentle introduction to machine learning with the Azure Machine Learning Studio (no linear algebra required!).  We'll explore it's intuitive interface, and break down the process of creating a trained AI using machine learning. We'll start with learning how to take your data and teach an AI with it. Next we'll learn how to improve the AI using custom scripts.  Finally, we'll look at deploying and using your AI for production scenarios.
