The advent of .NET Core has unleashed .NET in all its cross-platform power. And since you can write code in almost any platform, why should you be limited in how you write it? Join me so we can talk how you can unleash the power of .NET Core in everyone's favorite lightweight IDE, Visual Studio Code. We can debug C# 7 code, query databases, and become super productive without needing a full version of Visual Studio.
