Are your log files disorganized? Are they hard to parse and perform an investigation of the performance of your application? Do you have trouble tracking results of an A/B test? Does your business arm require you to have 27 different tracking pixels? If you answered YES to any of these questions come on down and learn how to make your life easier through instrumentation. In this session, we'll dig into how to best instrument an application by looking at a real-world example with a hand-rolled implementation. We'll talk about how to structure the messages and even look at a tool to parse them out so they can provide real business value. Disclaimer: there will be no actual playing of musical instruments in this session.
