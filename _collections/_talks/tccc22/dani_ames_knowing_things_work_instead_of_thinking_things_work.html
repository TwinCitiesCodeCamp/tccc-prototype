Production can be a scary environment. Sometimes things are working great and sometimes they're a complete dumpster fire. How do you know your current status? How do you know where your problem is or which server is causing the degradation? In this talk I'll discuss a journey from no application performance monitoring (APM) to "good enough to troubleshoot today" APM and where the team continued after our tire fire was turned back into a normal day. I'll focus on the abstract types of things to watch for and show how easy retrofitting these abilities can be, but for those curious, the examples are built on influxdb, telegraf, and grafana.
