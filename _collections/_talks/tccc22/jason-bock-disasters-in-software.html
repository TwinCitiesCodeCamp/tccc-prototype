Writing software isn't easy. In fact, it can be insanely hard at times. And when software fails, it can fail in spectacular, dramatic, and/or traumatic ways. In this session, I'll talk about the difficulties in getting software to work and techniques you should use to reduce the chances of epic disasters. We'll discuss well-known incidents of failures, both in software construction and other domains, and we'll learn from these aberrations.
