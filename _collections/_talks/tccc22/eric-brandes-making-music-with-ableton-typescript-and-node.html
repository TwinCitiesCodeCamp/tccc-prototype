Electronic musicians typically use a keyboard or MIDI controller to create music.  But, we’re software developers, so wouldn’t it be more fun if we could generate music with Typescript and Node? 

This talk is aimed at people of all musical levels.  I’ll discuss controlling a digital audio workstation (Ableton Live) with TypeScript, and show you how to use TypeScript and Node to generate MIDI clips for drums, chords, and topline melodies.  We’ll actually scaffold out song ideas live, using TypeScript to generate clips that are run through professional grade virtual instruments.  Attending this talk should inspire you to see coding as an equally valid avenue to create music, and give you the tools to do so!
