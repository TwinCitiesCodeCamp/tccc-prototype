Have you ever wanted to allow your users to be able to write scripts to execute actions within your application? Have you ever wondered how applications that do this accomplish it? During this talk we'll look at an app with a simple, easy to grok API, and and an interpreted scripting language created using the ANTLR4 Parser/Lexer generator, with which to drive it. All this, faster than you can say "The Dragon Book".
