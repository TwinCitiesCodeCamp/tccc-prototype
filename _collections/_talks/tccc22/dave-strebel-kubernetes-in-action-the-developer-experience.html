Containers are the next evolution in modern development, enabling organizations to be more agile than ever before. They can write their app once and deploy everywhere, whether dev, test or production. Containers can run on any hardware, on any cloud, and in any environment without modification. In short, they offer a truly open and portable solution for agile DevOps. This session will begin with a short intro to Kubernetes followed by an end to end demo of testing and deploying  a .Net Core application to a Kubernetes Cluster with a CI\CD pipeline. We will finish the session with lessons learned and best practices of using containers in production.
