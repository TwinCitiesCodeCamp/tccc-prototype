<p>    In this presentation we'll look at using the template method design pattern and    a fluent interface to create ordering criteria for sorting algorithms. We'll also    look at using the strategy design pattern to make the choice of sorting algorithm    easy to modify. Next, we'll throw in some IComparers, IComparables and events. Then,    we'll wrap it up by packaging the code in extension methods and demonstrate its    uses with LINQ and lambdas.</p>
