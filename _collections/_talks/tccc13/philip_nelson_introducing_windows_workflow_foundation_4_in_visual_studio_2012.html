<p>    At this session you can come and see an overview of what Windows Workflow Foundation    4 (WWF4) is with examples and pointers to more information for you to explore on    your own. WWF4 is made of designers, flow control, messaging, variables, collections    and and places to inject your own custom code. It is a developer tool but opens    the door to having your customers understand your system and processes more clearly.    You will leave with a better understanding of whether workflow in general and WWF4    in particular would be be a good fit for your purposes.</p>
