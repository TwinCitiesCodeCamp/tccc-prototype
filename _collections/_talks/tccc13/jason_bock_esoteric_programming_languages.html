<p>    Most of the time we program in modern languages like Ruby or C#. However, there    are a plethora of languages out there that are strange, odd, and/or just plain funny.    In this talk, I'll go over a number of esoteric programming languages such as Whenever,    Befunge, and LOLCODE. Come with a sense of humor!</p>
