<p>    Let's face it; we're not really artists (except for the artists). But that doesn't    mean we can't contribute to the images on the internet. Whether you're a Photoshop    guru, or don't even own a Mac, we can still make valuable contributions to ensure    our digital assets are crisp and professional. In this talk, we'll look at some    basic command-line tools for creating, modifying, and managing images, and look    at how we can manage them properly on the web. We'll play with sprites, responsive    images for these new retina displays, and techniques for optimizing performance    on lower bandwidth connections and mobile web.</p>
