<p>    The web has been evolving toward single page applications for a while now, and now    that they're here, a lot of tools and frameworks have been popping up to accomodate    their development. In this talk, we'll go through the history of the evolution of    single page applications and go over some of the more popular tools and frameworks    that people are using to build them, including Backbone.js, Node.js, Upshot.js,    Knockout.js and Microsoft's Single-Page Application project type. Given the topic    and angle of this talk, we will just HAVE to play buzzword bingo (I'll bring the    game cards).</p>
