<p>    The Hells Angels motorcycle club is one of the most famously known motorcycle clubs.    When you read about their infamous violence or run-ins with the law you rarely think    about them and how they use a computer or surf the internet. When professionals    talk about usability, itâ€™s hard not to think of people similar to themselves - but    what if your customers are not "typical" web users? How do you build for them or    discover how they interact with your site? In this talk Keith and Tim share their    real-world experience managing <a href="http://www.jpcycles.com" target="_blank">jpcycles.com</a>    (one of the world's 500 largest retail websites) and how they are working to identify    their customers' needs and adjusting their site to make it more friendly to their    motorcycle riding customers. Tim and Keith will share openly and honestly about    the tools they are using daily to maximize the experience and uncover "truth" in    their customers. Interestingly great website design is much aligned with the Hells    Angels motto: "When we do right, nobody remembers. When we do wrong, nobody forgets."</p>
