<p>    Is your system bleeding valuable business data? Regular HTTP-based web and WCF services    are unreliable. Server crashes and deadlocks cause data to disappear. NServiceBus    is a .NET Enterprise Service Bus framework that will help you correctly apply the    principles of service oriented architecture to stop it. And yes, it works with Azure    too. Learn the basics of asynchronous messaging, publish/subscribe, and long-running    workflows (sagas) and how you can use them to build a more reliable and maintainable    distributed system.</p>
