<p>    One of the hot industry trends right now is the movement towards development for    phones and tablets. There are a lot of corporate developers with experience developing    on the Microsoft platforms, and MVC in particular. The ASP.NET MVC4 Framework is    out now and has many new features, including support for mobile devices. In this    session, you'll build on your existing MVC skills and leverage those new features    to deliver smart websites that adapt to different devices. We'll discuss how to    build mobile-friendly web pages using MVC4 and jQuery.Mobile, we'll review some    of the new MVC4 features, and also hit on a few other topics that are covered in    more detail in the speaker's book "Delivering Mobile-Friendly WebSites with MVC4".</p>
