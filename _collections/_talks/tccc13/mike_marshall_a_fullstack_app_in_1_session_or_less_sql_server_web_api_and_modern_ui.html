<p>    You may or may not have noticed lately but Microsoft is moving your cheese. WCF    is out and ASP.NET Web API is in. Windows Forms is out and "Modern UI" (Formerly    "Metro") is in. During this session we'll start by designing our database schema    in SQL Server. Next, we'll expose our data via an HTTP API using Web API. Then we'll    tie it all together by writing a Windows 8 Modern UI-style application that consumes    our data and makes it available to the user. If we want to finish we'll need to    do away with the pleasantries and write code right out of the gate.</p>
