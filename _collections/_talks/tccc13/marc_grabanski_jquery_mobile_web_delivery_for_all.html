<p>    Mobile web development frameworks are targeting the builtin web browsers on iPhone    and Android only; however, jQuery mobile has in a different vision, one that will    reach the largest distribution of phones possible. Leveraging the ways of progressive    enhancement, your website can be viewed in raw HTML on old mobile phones and then    enhanced with nice CSS styles across mobile platforms that have a decent CSS and    JavaScript support. In this session, Marc gives you his list of reasons to use jQuery    mobile, an overview of the framework and will draw from his experiences building    websites on top of jQuery Mobile.</p>
