In this session you will learn about key extensions to IIS to simplify    working with your web application. Manage a web farm, handle URL rewriting, implement    application load balancing, sync content and configuration between servers, or use    shared configuration. Learn how to manage databases through IIS manager, create    FTP sites, and script common tasks with PowerShell. You will leave this session    having a new arsenal of tools for working with IIS.</p>
