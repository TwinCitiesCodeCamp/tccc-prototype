<p>    Everything has been gamified today; the leafy tree on your hybrid car, credit card    points, electric bills, and the slew of retail rewards programs. Then three are    games themselves, grandmas and toddlers are playing massively multi-player online    games. Games are huge parts of our lives, even if we donâ€™t realize it. In this session    we will explore how game theory drives behavior. What are key gaming concepts that    we can leverage in our applications? How do we satisfy different gamer demographics    when building actual games? The games industry is in a huge shift of both decline    and growth. Where is gaming going? This session will strive to create a greater    appreciation for the complexity of game theory and the behavior it drives.</p>
