<p>    Outages happen. Software has bugs, hardware fails, people make mistakes. In the    increasingly complex world we live in, the demand for systems that can adapt to    failures is becoming more important every day. Cloud Computing is helping show us    how to solve these problems. In this session we will discuss some of the lessons    learned in the cloud and how we can apply them to software no matter where its running.</p>
