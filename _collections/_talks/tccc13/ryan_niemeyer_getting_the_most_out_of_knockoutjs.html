<p>    Knockout.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic user interfaces.    Getting started with Knockout is easy, but as your application grows in complexity,    it can be challenging to keep your code clean and performing optimally. In this    session, we will talk about the tools, tricks, and techniques that you can use to    take your Knockout application to the next level. Topics will include extending    Knockout's structures, creating custom bindings, taking advantage of some lesser-known    Knockout APIs and avoiding common performance issues.</p>
