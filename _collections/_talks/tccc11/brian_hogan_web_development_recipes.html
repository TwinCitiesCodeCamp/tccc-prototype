<p>    Modern web development takes more than just HTML and CSS with a little JavaScript    mixed in. Clients want more responsive sites with faster interfaces that work on    multiple devices, and you need the latest tools and techniques to make that happen.    Our talk will include some web development recipes to get you introduced to some    of the best tools for web development. This talk is not focused on a specific language,    but is targeted for the modern day web developer. We'll cover topics that can be    used with most modern day frameworks and languages, so you can expand your .NET,    PHP or Ruby site to have some fun new features.</p>
