<p>    Database performance remains a critical factor in overall application performance    and scalability. This session is targeted at application developers who wish improve    their understanding of database performance and how applications interact with the    database. This session will target SQL Server, though the concepts are applicable    to most large scale enterprise databases. This session will focus on how to query    SQL Server's Dynamic Management Views (DMV's) to identify the performance bottlenecks    in an application. It will also cover how to interpret how the database is processing    your queries and how to tune your queries to run faster. Finally, I'll cover some    of the most common database performance issues encountered by application teams    and discuss some strategies for addressing them.</p>
