<p>    You've downloaded the Kinect SDK for Windows, you've played with the samples, and    you've even written your own crude Kinect app in Windows 7. In this 200-level session    we'll take Kinect programming to the next level and discuss qualities of motion-based    Natural User Interface (NUI) apps that will help turn your Kinect app into a pleasing    user experience. We'll talk about good patterns for incorporating the Kinect runtime    in WPF applications, how to deal with noisy background user traffic, speech recognition,    creative ways to utilize the runtime, and other topics</p>
