<p>    There has been a surge in conversations about Domain Specific languages and DSL    technology in the last couple of years. This talk is for language enthusiasts and    those curious about how they can harness Domain Specific Languages today. I will    talk a little bit about what DSLs are and why you should be interested in them and    then delve into how you can use meta# to create your own DSLs.</p>
