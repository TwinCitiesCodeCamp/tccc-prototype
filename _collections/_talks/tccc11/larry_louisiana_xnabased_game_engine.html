<p>    We will talk slightly about what XNA is and does then we will dive into the internals    and code a IOC based XNA base framework and develop a little game all in the session.    We will cover IOC in XNA, the component based approach to game development and general    XNA pitfalls. We will create a simple side scrolling space ship game, then show    how to improve it.</p>
