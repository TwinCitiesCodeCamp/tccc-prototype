<p>    Windows Azure is Microsoft's Cloud Solution for Platform as a Service (PaaS) that    allows developers to build solutions that take advantage of the scalability, performance    and distribution promises of the cloud. In this talk we'll dive into what is new    with the latest release of the SDK, the tools for Visual Studio, and the Management    Portal. We will explore how to deploy, configure and scale applications, as well    as explore new features like Geo Replication, Traffic Manager and the Service Bus.</p>
