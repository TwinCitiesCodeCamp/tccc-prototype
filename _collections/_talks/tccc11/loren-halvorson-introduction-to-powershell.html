<p>    Learn how to use Powershell to automate just about anything. We will learn to use    the Powershell discovery, object manipulation, and transformation utilities and    demonstrate how to script against .NET, COM, WMI and XML. We will also see how easy    it is to host Powershell in your own application, and much more. Real examples of    using Powershell to automate tedious developer tasks will be explored.</p>
