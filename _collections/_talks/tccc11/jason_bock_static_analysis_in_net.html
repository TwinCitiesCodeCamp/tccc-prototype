<p>    We all want to have someone else review our code to make sure it's written well.    Wouldn't it be even better if we can have that review process done automatically?    In this session, you'll see how you can use static analysis tools (like Code Analysis/FxCop)    to find all kinds of implementation issues before they show up in a release. You'll    also find out how to manage rule sets in Visual Studio, and find out how you can    create your own custom rules.</p>
