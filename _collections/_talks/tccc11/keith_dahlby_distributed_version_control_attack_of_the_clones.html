<p>    Everyone needs version control, but does it really matter what you use? As distributed    systems like Git and Mercurial have taught us, it turns out it matters quite a bit.    This talk will review the core concepts of distributed version control, show off    a few advanced features you didn't know you needed, and discuss options for getting    started now rather than later.</p>
