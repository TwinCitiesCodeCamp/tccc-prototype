<p>    The MVVM design pattern quickly became the defacto approach for building WPF and    Silverlight applications. But, are you also using the MVVM Light Toolkit? The MVVM    LightToolkit helps to avoid memory leaks, creates safe property notifications, allows    for flexible eventing, and more. Most importantly, MVVM Light Toolkit is a small    resource that can be added to any existing project without requiring rearchitecture    of your existing code. In this session we will explore the benefits of using the    MVVM Light toolkit in your WPF, Silverlight, and Windows Phone applications.</p>
