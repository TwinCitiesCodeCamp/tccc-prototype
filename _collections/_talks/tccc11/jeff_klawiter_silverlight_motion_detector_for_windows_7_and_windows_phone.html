<p>    Ever want to know if someone is heading towards your cube/office/domicile before    they appear behind you scaring the crap out of ya? Here's your chance to learn how    to build a motion detection application yourself. Using the Native Extensions for    Silverlight and Silverlight Out Of Browser we will build a program that will utilize    features of Windows 7 to let you know when motion was detected. As an added bonus    we will go over porting the application to Windows Phone 7 Mango taking advantage    of the new raw camera access.</p>
