<p>    Are you Hadoop curious? If so, this session is for you. Apache Hadoop and "big data"    are the hottest buzz words in the IT space. In this session, we will discuss the    Hadoop architecture and then dive right into working code examples to solve increasingly    complex problems. The problems we intend to tackle are word count, analytics, and    finally handling updates with no random write functionality. All attendees will    be given the code discussed in class and a downloadable virtual machine ready to    execute the code examples discussed in class.</p>
