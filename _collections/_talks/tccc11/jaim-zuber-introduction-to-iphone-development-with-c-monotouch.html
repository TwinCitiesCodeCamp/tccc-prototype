<p>    "Great job with your MVC/Sliverlight/Whatever app! We're going to need that on the    iPhone too. How long will that take?" Have you run into this question yet? You will.    This session will help you wade through the staggering number of development options    available and give you the info needed to make the right decisions for your Client,    Product or Organization. We'll start with an overview of the Mobile ecosystem and    the basic concepts of the Cocoa Touch framework. From there we'll dig into MonoTouch    and show the power and flexibility it provides over native Objective-C development.    We'll also give a tour of some time saving libraries like MonoTouch.Dialog that,    well, just make our lives easier.</p>
