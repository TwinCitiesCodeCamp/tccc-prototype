<p>    The .NET framework is perhaps the most extensible, and stable way to go about cross-platform    development. Unlike native languages, it offers a byte-code which can be JITted    to high-performance native code at runtime, and offers near-native speeds on various    platforms such as Windows Phone, Windows 98-Windows 7, Windows 8, and Linux. Although    the same byte-code can be run on all platforms, the difficulty is often finding    libraries that will work on all these platforms, without the need to re-write your    code for each one. In this session, I will be introducing a cross-platform library,    which works seamlessly across all these platforms, and can be used to write high-performance    games, and other 3D applications for all the platforms above. This project is currently    available as an open-source library on <a href="https://github.com/IDWMaster/3DAPI" target="_blank">Github</a>, and anyone is welcome to contribute to it.</p>
