<p>    While most of us were looking at new features like Linq when C# 3.0 and VB9 came    out, behind the scenes, a much more interesting and powerful feature snuck in -    the ability to write programs that literally write themselves! In this session,    we explore how to write programs that write themselves using the classes in the    System.Linq.Expressions namespace. These classes allow you to evaluate code at runtime    and even write new code at runtime - without having to resort to IL generation (why    should Lisp hackers get all the fun?). You will learn how to use the classes in    the namespace, how they work together, as well as some examples of how such things    can be useful in ordinary line of business applications.</p>
