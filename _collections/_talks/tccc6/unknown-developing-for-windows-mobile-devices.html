<p>    Mobile development is growing fast, and Windows Mobile is at the forefront with    over 18 million phones shipped last year and many more cutting-edge devices on the    way. Visual Studio developers have tremendous opportunities in this space. Why?    Developing for a Windows Mobile phone leverages your existing coding experience    and takes it to new heights. In this session, we'll look at some of the coolest    new devices, you'll learn how to set up Visual Studio with the latest SDK and device    emulators, and you'll see how to build, deploy and debug Windows Mobile applications.    We'll work with building a realistic application, working with data and finally    packaging it up.</p>
