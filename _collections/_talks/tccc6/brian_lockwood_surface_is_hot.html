<p>    Stop, drop and roll your way into Microsoft Surface development. This session will    focus on what Microsoft Surface is, how to interact with it, and what language drives    it. The session will finish up with a simple code demonstration to hose it all down.    [Note: The speaker is opposite of wealthy so there will not be an actual Microsoft    Surface unit, the demonstrations will be done using the Surface Emulator]</p>
