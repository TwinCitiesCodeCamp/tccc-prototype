<p>    In DemoFest events, we demonstrate an end-to-end solution that takes technologies    and tools we discussed in other BenkoTips webcasts and applies them to create something    fun. We look at some of the new features in Microsoft SQL Server 2008, including    data types for spatial data, and how we can use these features to build interesting    applications. We then take this functionality and expose it using a Windows Communication    Foundation (WCF) service. Finally, we explore the software development kit (SDK)    for Microsoft Virtual Earth and how we can build on top of this rich interactive    platform using new Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) and JavaScripting capabilities    in Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.</p>
