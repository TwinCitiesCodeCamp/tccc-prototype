<p>    This session will introduce you to the WPF Composite Application Library. Using    the Comp App Library, developers can quickly build a WPF application that can be    extended with customized UI modules, services, events, and more. We will take a    look at getting a Composite Application initialized, adding custom modules, building    views, and coordinating services and UI interactions using the CAL.</p>
