<p>    When you're using Shoes, programming is really fun again. Shoes is a simple yet    powerful application framework for developing cross-platform desktop applications.    In just a few lines of code, you can be pulling feeds from Twitter, and in a few    more, you can be grabbing videos from YouTube. Kids as young as five years old are    learning to program using Shoes because it's so easy and comfortable, but it's also    extremely flexible too. You can use it to check on the status of your servers or    as a frontend to pushing code into production. In this session, you'll learn about    the Shoes framework and see how easy it is to build something fun and useful.</p>
