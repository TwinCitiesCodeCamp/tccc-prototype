<p>    With Visual Studio 2010, F# will officially become a first-class citizen in the    .NET development ecosystem. This session will explore functional programming, why    it matters in an object-oriented world, and how F# bridges the gap. I will also    discuss some lessons learned from using F# with OpenCV, an unmanaged computer vision    library.</p>
