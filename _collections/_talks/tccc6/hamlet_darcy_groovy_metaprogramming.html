<p>    <a href="http://svn.assembla.com/svn/SampleCode/presentations/metaprogramming/metaprogramming.odp" target="_blank">Presentation Materials</a></p><p>    Ruby's monkeypatching brought the idea of metaprogramming to the masses, or at least    to those that weren't exposed to it in Lisp or C. At its best, metaprogramming can    greatly improve productivity, as is the case with Grails, but at its worst it can    destroy expectations and induce versioning confusion. This talk introduces the myriad    metaprogramming techniques Groovy and dynamic typing allows, shows how some of them    are used in real life, and compares them to what's available in other languages.    Oh yeah, all code will be written live.</p>
