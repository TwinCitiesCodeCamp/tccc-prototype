<p>    <a href="http://blog.j-maxx.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/TwinCitiesCodeCampPresentation_AAC6/Visual Studio Productivity.pptx" target="_blank">Presentation Materials</a></p><p>    Visual Studio is one of the greatest development environments out there. It includes    many shortcuts and features to make your life easier as a developer. Some of those    features are not always user friendly to get set up. The main focus will be on using    snippets to improve your development experience with common patterns in LINQ and    data objects. We will also cover various shortcuts and windows. No one is an expert,    you will be encouraged to share your own tips and tricks.</p>
