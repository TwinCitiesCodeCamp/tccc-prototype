<p>    With the addition of the new ASP.NET MVC framework there will be a lot of questions    surrounding how this technology can be used instead of the Web Forms that we all    have been used to since .NET 1.0. With the addition of the MVC Framework we now    have the best of the old world ASP Classic, with a compiled and easier to debug    workspace. This session will cover a quick overview of the MVC framework, and continue    with building a 'Real World' application. The message that will be carried from    within the session will be how the MVC Framework can be harnessed in future projects    within the attendee's future projects. This will be a "Must See" session for any    web developer looking to the future.</p>
