Most API developers are familiar with JSON-based REST type methods used to define their routes.  But GraphQL and gRPC have recently been introduced, and both have some key advantages that can be leveraged in certain situations.  What are those advantages?  When should you use GraphQL- or gRPC-flavored APIs?  Are there security implications of these API protocols?  We will explore the differences between these three options, as well as look at some concrete demos of each and see how they behave in practice.  The demos will be done using ASP.NET Core, but the techniques and protocols are consistent across any language used to develop APIs.
