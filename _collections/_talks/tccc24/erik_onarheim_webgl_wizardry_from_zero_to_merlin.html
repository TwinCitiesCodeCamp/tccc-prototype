WebGL is a very powerful way to generate 2D or 3D graphics for the web. If you have ever been curious about webgl for building visualizations, data processing, or making a game, come to this talk to learn how you can build your next experience.

In this talk, I’ll demystify the WebGL API and explain what the various pieces are and how they fit together to build visuals. I’ll cover some debugging techniques, writing shaders, performance tricks, and introduce some libraries that can make your life easier. You too can become a WebGL wizard!
