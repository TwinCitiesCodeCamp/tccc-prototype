WebAssembly has opened up a world of new possibilities for building Artificial Intelligences. We now have the tools we need to push sophisticated AI models to the client for execution in any environment. In this talk we will take a deep dive into building AI models for use on the client side. We create AI models using open-source tooling and use Blazor to operationalize those models into WebAssembly running in the client's browser.
