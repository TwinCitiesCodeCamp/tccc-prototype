Azure started as a Platform as a Service with Cloud Services, but since it launched has evolved to include several newer and very useful options for compute. Depending on your hosting model and how you do DevOps, requirements for scalability and availability you have tradeoffs that affect your long term costs and decision. We will explore the options for compute in Azure including  Iaas, Application Services, Containers with Kubernetes and Dev Spaces,  and Serverless with Functions. We'll show this using the tools in Visual Studio and in VS Code as well as DevOps, and we'll help you understand the tradeoffs and help you make smart decisions on what makes the most sense to ensure you can maximize the return on your investment
