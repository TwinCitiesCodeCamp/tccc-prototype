There's no shortage of digital ink spilled on what the cloud can do for you. Instead of hitching your wagon to a specific provider, why not build your apps so they can work in nearly any cloud, including your own data center?

In this talk, you're going to learn how to build cloud native ASP.NET Core applications. You'll learn how to design ASP.NET Core apps that work well in cloud environments. You'll also learn how to use Docker and Kubernetes to host your apps on whatever cloud you want. By the end of this talk, you'll be ready to build ASP.NET apps that can run anywhere.
