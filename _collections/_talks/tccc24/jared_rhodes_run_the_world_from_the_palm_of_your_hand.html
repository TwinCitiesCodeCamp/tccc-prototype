In this session, we will look at how Xamarin Mobile apps can be used to interface with headless devices through wireless technology. With the strong adoption of Internet of Things devices, or devices without a direct interface, a common form of interaction is widely used. That interaction is through the computer most people carry with them every day, a mobile phone. After this presentation, attendees will have a strong understanding of how to use Xamarin in their Internet of Things story.
