Unity. Ninject. Autofac. These are all popular frameworks that have been made redundant with the new ASP.NET Core built-in dependency injection (DI) framework. In this talk, we'll explore some new features of ASP.NET Core such as the request handling pipeline, defining custom middleware components, the configuration framework, and the options pattern for storing and and retrieving configuration values. We'll finish the talk by going over some brief examples of how this all ties together with a demo that tests Azure's AD B2C auth and some forms validation with FluentValidation.
