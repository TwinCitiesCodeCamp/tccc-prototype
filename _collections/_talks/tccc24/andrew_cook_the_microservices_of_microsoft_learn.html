We will dive into the many microservices which together make Microsoft Learn an online interactive learning platform. Microsoft Learn is built upon Azure in .NET using multiple services including Web Apps, Azure Functions, Traffic Managers, Service Bus, Event Grid, and Cosmos Db. Each of the services incorporates CI/CD which allows for independent development and deployment to increase the speed at which new features and changes can be completed.
