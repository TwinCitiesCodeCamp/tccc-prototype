Who says that programming must be practical? Let's throw caution to the wind and explore kOS â€” a programmable autopilot for Kerbal Space Program. It's a wild west where there are no standard libraries, no classes, and no try/catch blocks! But there are real problems to solve, including PID controllers, orbital maneuver calculations, and even machine learning.<br><br>Join us as we write dangerous code that launches brave Kerbals into outer space on wobbly rockets in a video game. For science!
