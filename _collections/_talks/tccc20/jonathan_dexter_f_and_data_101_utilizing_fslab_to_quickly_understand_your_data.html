In this talk, we’re going to run through a suite of tools that the F# community has created to bring the power of F# to data manipulation and modeling. Utilizing the functional-first, typed architecture that F# provides, FsLab is a collection of packages which allow data to be explored and understood. These packages include: F# Data, which utilizes F#’s type provider system to create concrete types without boilerplate classes; Deedle, which allows swift in-memory manipulations and transformations of data; and visualization and more packages. We’ll touch on F# syntax as we go. Come join and take a crash course through these tools.
