As the user experience becomes more important, real-time push notifications are an important tool for web developers to master. Learn how to build real-time server-to-client and client-to-server push services in ASP.NET using SignalR. SignalR makes it incredibly simple to build communication hubs for real-time notifications, peer-to-peer collaboration, and real-time content delivery. SignalR is flexible, extensible and scalable. We will cover setting up a complete MVC5 application using both the Javascript client API and the .NET client. There are several transport protocols available depending on which server and client platforms you are using. We will discuss these options as well as extending, scaling and customizing SignalR.
