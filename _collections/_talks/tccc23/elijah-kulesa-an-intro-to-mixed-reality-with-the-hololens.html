Let your apps respond to reality with the Hololens. In this talk, we'll see Mixed Reality in action - and learn to do the same! We'll create a project in Unity and learn how to put our own models into 3D space. Then we'll visualize and map the real-world. With that, our models can respond and interact with our world. Once that's done, we'll go the other way and use the built-in gesture system to control our models. Come learn to let your apps live in the real-world!
