<p>At first sight Kubernetes can seem daunting for most users, as it has many abstractions. Knowing where to start with Kubernetes is half the battle and focusing on learning the core concepts can ease the knowledge gap.</p>
<p>
In this talk we will go from :</p>
<ol>
<li> Running a Microservice based application on your computer.</li>
<li>Building container images for each service of the Microservice application.</li>
<li>Introduction to Kubernetes. Deploying a Microservice based application into a Kubernetes Managed Cluster.</li>
</ol>
<p>The gradual build up provides the depth required for a mere mortal being able to grasp the simplicity of Kubernetes. Yes, Kubernetes is not so complex when you start with the core concepts and understand the abstractions it provides to the end-user.</p>
