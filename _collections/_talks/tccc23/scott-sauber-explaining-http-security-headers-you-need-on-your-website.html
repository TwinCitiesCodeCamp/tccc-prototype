In this session, we'll explain a handful of HTTP Security Headers (including HSTS, CSP, XFO, and more) from the bottom up. We'll explain what they are, what they do, and how you can implement them to secure your sites. On each of these, we'll demo a before and after so you can see first hand what each of these security headers do.
