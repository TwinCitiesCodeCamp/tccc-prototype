Most web sites don’t have data that changes, so why power them with a database and take the performance hit, or worse, inflict it on your visitors?

In this talk we’ll explore how to build a web site using Hugo, an open-source tool for building static content sites quickly. In this live demo, you’ll learn how to make a master layout for your pages, how to create content templates to stamp out new pages quickly, how to use Markdown to build content, and how to get all the other pieces a static site needs.

Then you'll see how to deploy the site we made to production using containers. After the talk, you’ll be able to build and deploy static web sites quickly with minimal tooling.
