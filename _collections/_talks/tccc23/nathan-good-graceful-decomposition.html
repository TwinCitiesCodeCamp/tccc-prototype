<p>Once you've made a decision to modernize your Java Enterprise Edition applications, how do you safely decompose your monolith into micro services?</p>

<p>Many enterprises are undergoing initiatives to modernized their monolithic application into micro services. But the act of decomposition isn't always straight-forward, and decomposing an application incorrectly can cause more problems than it solves. How do you handle common code to prevent rework? How do you get the most benefit out of deployment isolation? </p>

<p>In this session, I examine several time-tested techniques that can be used to gracefully decompose your monolith into useful micro services. Using good practices, you will get the most out of your new architecture.</p>

<p>Walk away from this session with techniques and practices that will help you be successful with micro services from monoliths.</p>
