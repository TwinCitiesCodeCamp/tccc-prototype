Clojure is alive and well - a pragmatic Lisp for the real world, on both the JVM and the CLR. Although the language and its libraries are interesting in their own right, what is perhaps even more powerful is the Lisp way of working - building your app at the REPL, from the bottom up. In this talk, Kurt Christensen will build a simple Clojure app in real time, and hopes to show you new ways of approaching your work.
