This talk will be about my experience using RabbitMQ as a message broker between our microservices. Over the years I've used messaging systems such as MSMQ, NServiceBus, MassTransit and others. What I've found is RabbitMQ just works and is simple to use.  I'll talk about the basics of RabbitMQ messaging options and techniques we have used to ensure reliable messaging.
