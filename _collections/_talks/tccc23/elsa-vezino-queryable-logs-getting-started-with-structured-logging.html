In this age of blossoming data analytics, even your logs can be aggregated to find the most important information quickly! This talk will start by showing you an example application using Serilog, one of the top libraries available for .NET. Next we'll demonstrate how to navigate structured logs and how it compares to traditional logging. We will cover libraries available for the different development platforms so you can pick an approach that works for you. If you are interested in taking your logging to the next level, this talk is for you!
