The Microsoft Bot Framework, Azure Bot Service and Cognitive Services enable creating complex conversational experiences in minutes.  In this session I will demonstrate multiple tools useful for creating intelligent bots that understand human language, communicate on various channels, and tap into the power of Azure.  I'll also show how to use both the Node and .Net Bot Builder SDKs.
