The syntax for Async / Await in C# is straightforward but the under-the-covers mechanics are not. This discussion will provide a high-level understanding of those mechanics so you can be a true wizard with Async / Await in C#. We will start with an example showing the amazing performance gains that can be had using Async / Await. Then discuss Task Based Asynchronous Processing and the under-the-covers mechanisms ExecutionContext and SynchronizationContext to understand their role. We finish with some advanced examples showing the power of the Tasks namespace. This is an intermediate discussion for C# developers who are already using Async/Await.
