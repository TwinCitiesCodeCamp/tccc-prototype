<p>    Continuous Delivery is a great way to reduce times in development cycles and deploy new features and enhancements faster. In this session, we will cover the build pipeline and all the different steps that are needed to automate a release cycle. We will review a simple website example and watch it from start to finish, covering configuration steps. Examples will be shown using Visual Studio, Git, Selenium, AppVeyor, Load Impact, Sauce Labs Continuous Integration, and Azure / Azure Powershell Management technologies for deployment.</p>
