<p>    It's been awhile since the flood of build a blog in 15 minutes in Rails videos, presentation and blog posts have flooded the internet.  The barrier to entry in the Rails world has increased for the average developer over the last few years.  I'm going to bring back the kickstart approach to building Rails applications.  Here we are going to learn how to build a Rails app and deploy it in 60 minutes.  We'll talk about the application structure, build a sample application and deploy it (pending internet connectivity). We'll even approach some topics like unit testing and styling.</p>
