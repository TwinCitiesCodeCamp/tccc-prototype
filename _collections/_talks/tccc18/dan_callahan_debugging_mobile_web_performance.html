<p>    The mobile web continues to be a challenging place for developers and users alike. In this session, attendees will learn how to diagnose issues that occur in mobile browsers, with an emphasis on tooling and performance testing. This session isnâ€™t aimed at experts, but at developers who know the foundations of the web (HTML, CSS, JS) and want to learn how to tackle bugs on mobile browsers. We'll specifically look at performance in terms of networking, framerate, and, memory use.</p>
