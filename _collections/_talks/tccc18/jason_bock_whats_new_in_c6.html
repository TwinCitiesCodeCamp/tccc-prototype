<p>    Dissatisfied that C# 5 only added async and await? In C# 6 you're going to get a lot more features! In this session we'll cover what these features are (e.g. nameof and string interpolation) and how they work in detail so you'll know when to use them effectively in your new .NET projects.</p>
