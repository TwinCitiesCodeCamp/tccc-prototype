<p>    In this talk I give an overview of several cutting-edge web development technologies. Rather than being general purpose programming languages, they focus solely on the task of developing for the web. These languages use DSLs to simplify the common tasks of writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and interacting with the database. Also differing from many dynamic language web stacks, these languages employ static type systems which can catch many common errors early in the development cycle; saving on a lot of debugging time.</p><p>    The frameworks that I'll cover are: Opa, Ur/Web, and Elm. The talk will also cover some functional programming techniques that are in common use in the frameworks.</p><p>    I'll present several reasons why I think that web development is tending towards these sorts of technologies. Even if you don't find yourself using one of these in particular, you may well end up using the concepts that they contain.</p>
