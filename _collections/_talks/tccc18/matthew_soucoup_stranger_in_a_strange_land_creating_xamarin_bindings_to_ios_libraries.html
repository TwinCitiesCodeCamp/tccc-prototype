<p>    Imagine this… You’re developing an app using Xamarin and come across a whiz-bang, flashy Objective-C UI library on GitHub which would be a perfect fit. You know there’s a way to consume this library with Xamarin, but everything just looks so, so … strange.</p><p>    In this session we'll take the mystery out of binding and consuming these strange Objective-C libraries to C# and Xamarin.  First we’ll cover the idioms of Objective-C to get a feel for the land.  Then start to find our way around by mapping Obj-C to C#.  Finally, we’ll add the niceties of home by extending the functionality of the original library with a more C# approach.  By the end of this journey, binding Obj-C to C# will feel just like home!</p>
