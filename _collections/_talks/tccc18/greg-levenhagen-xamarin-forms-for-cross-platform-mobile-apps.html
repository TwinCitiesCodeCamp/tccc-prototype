<p>    Mobile apps are clearly here to stay. As developers, weâ€™ve seen a lot of technologies come and go that promised a write-once and run-everywhere scenario. Xamarin has been around for a while and allowing developers to use a C# code base with native user interfaces. Last summer, Xamarin added support for the user interface under the brand of Xamarin Forms, which provides a XAML-like implementation for markup. This lets developers use C# and XAML to write mobile apps to target iOS, Android and Windows Phone.</p><p>    Come see what Xamarin.Forms can do for you, where it may fit it and the pros and cons of this type of cross platform mobile development. This will largely be demos, code and walk-throughs.</p>
