<p>    Creating HTML5 games and animated applications that run in any recent browser on any desktop, laptop, tablet or smart phone requires planning and a few special techniques.  Topics covered are: Planning the scenes and interactions, designing the layout, detecting the device and window size, sizing the canvas, scaling the graphics, performing animations, responding to keyboard and mouse events on laptops and desktops, responding to touch events on tablets and smart phones, and completing the game with appropriate interactions. A simple “Keep Away” game will be used to demonstrate the techniques.</p>
