<p>    Building Angular directives can be a challenging proposition, building reusable directives is even harder, and building ones that scale is a whole different beast.  We will walk you through building a Angular tree directive from scratch that handles tens of thousands of nodes while maintaining performance.  We will show you where the dragons live and how to skirt their lairs.  Included topics:  Avoiding digest cycle limitations, compilation and linking and why it matters to you, templating without using transclusion (for reasons we will discuss), and why all of this is going to get better for developers in Angular 2.0.</p>
