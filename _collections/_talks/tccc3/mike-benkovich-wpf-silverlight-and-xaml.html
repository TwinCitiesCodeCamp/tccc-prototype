<p>    Working with XAML, a new way of declaratively creating user interface elements,    the professional design tools and innovative technologies in Expression give you    the flexibility and freedom to bring your vision to reality - whether you are designing    standards-based Web sites, rich user experiences on the desktop, or managing digital    assets and content. In this session, we'll look at the products that make up Expression    Studio and how they are used together to make great user experiences a reality both    on the web and on the desktop. We'll dive deep into Expression Blend and Expression    Design to see how they can be used along with Visual Studio 2005 to deliver rich    interfaces based on Windows Presentation Foundation for online and offline scenarios.</p>
