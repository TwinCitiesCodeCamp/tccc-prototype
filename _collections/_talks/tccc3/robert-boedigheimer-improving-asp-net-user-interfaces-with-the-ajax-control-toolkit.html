<p>    There are many controls and extenders provided by the AJAX Control Toolkit that    can be used to enhance ASP.NET user interfaces. The ValidatorCallout is used with    the existing validation controls to show a nice box with the validation message    that points to the field in error. The CollapsiblePanel provides an area of the    screen that can be collapsed to hide the content but leave a title bar with the    header. The ModalPopup displays a popup window and disables the remainder of the    page. There are many controls provided which provide a much richer experience for    ASP.NET web sites.</p>
