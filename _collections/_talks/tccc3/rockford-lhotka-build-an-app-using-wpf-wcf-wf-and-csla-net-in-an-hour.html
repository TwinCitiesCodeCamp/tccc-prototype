<p>    Using .NET 3.0 and CSLA .NET, see how you can build a (small) application in an    hour. The resulting app will have a UI layer, business layer and data layer. The    WPF UI will be rich and interactive, but nearly code-less. The application will    include both n-tier and service-oriented features, and will leverage WF for back-end    processing. Tired of PowerPoint? Want to see non-stop coding action? Then this session    is for you!</p>
