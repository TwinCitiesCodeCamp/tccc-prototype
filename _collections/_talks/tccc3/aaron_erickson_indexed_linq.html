<p>    This session will discuss how the new features of C# 3.0 enable LINQ to work, and    how by using the new features of C# 3.0, you can extend LINQ to do enable innovation.    I will give an example of this in practice by demonstrating the building of an indexing    mechanism over LINQ to objects.</p>
