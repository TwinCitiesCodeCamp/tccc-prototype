<p>    Data access has evolved over time to make working with databases easier and more    productive. In the Microsoft .NET Framework version 3.5, access to data is integrated    natively into the languages. In this session, we look at some of these technologies    including LINQ and Astoria and see how they impact our development approach. We'll    dive into the ADO.NET Entity framework and explore how to create and use the models    to map our way back to the data stores.</p>
