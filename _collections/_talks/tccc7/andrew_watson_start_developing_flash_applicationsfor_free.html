<p>    With the open-source release of Adobe's Flex SDK, anyone can start developing Flash    applications. It's true that Adobe's tools -- the Flash and Flex IDEs -- help make    developing Flash applications easier. But with knowledge of some particular parts    of the Flex compiler and Actionscript 3, a person could actually run a professional    Flash development business with no up front cost! Join Andrew as he takes you through    downloading and configuring the Flex SDK with a particularly cool and free IDE.    You'll see Actionscript 3 in action, covering those aspects of the language that    will help you make real-world interactive applications. Together you'll make an    XML-driven website navigation menu. Come and get your Flash development career started    for free!</p>
