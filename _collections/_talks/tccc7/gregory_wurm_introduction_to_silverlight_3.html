<p>    In this talk we will create three examples of commonly requested flash components    but create them in Silverlight. We will create a custom video player, Interactive    Photo Gallery and a Dynamic Menu generated from XML. This presentation will be a    great way for .Net developers to get into Silverlight or induce Flash/Flex Silverlight    and .NET.</p>
