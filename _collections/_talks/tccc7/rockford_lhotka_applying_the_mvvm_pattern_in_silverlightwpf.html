<p>    Building an app using XAML is different from both earlier Windows and web development    models. While there's still room for the MVC and MVP design patterns, the unique    capabilities of XAML mean that the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern is    often a better option. In this session you'll get a basic understanding of the MVVM    design pattern itself, and more importantly will see practical examples of its use    in building Silverlight and WPF applications.</p>
