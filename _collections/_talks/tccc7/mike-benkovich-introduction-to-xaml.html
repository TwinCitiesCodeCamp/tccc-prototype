<p>    Creating a rich user experience involves diving into some unique challenges. How    do you work with data from various sources? How do you take advantage of modern    media elements? What can you do to integrate all these things into an application    that works? XAML provides a powerful schema for approaching the next generation    of rich interactive applications both on the PC and on the Internet. In this session,    we look at the programming model and tools that developers and designers can leverage    to build these true next-generation experiences for consumers and business, and    we demonstrate how to use XAML to build rich interactive applications using XAML    and Microsoft .NET. We explore how to use Microsoft Visual Studio and Microsoft    Expression Blend to create applications and compelling UI using XAML markup, code,    controls, and file I/O. We also discuss networking, how to retrieve data from a    Web service, and various other aspects of building Silverlight applications.</p>
