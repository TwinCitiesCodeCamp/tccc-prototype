<p>    The Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio is a robust and powerful environment for    hobbyist, pedagogical and expert robotic design and prototyping. It allows, without    any robotics parts, visual feedback of algorithms for a variety of robotic platforms.    In this talk, we will walk through some of the more interesting features of the    Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio, both the Express version and the Academic/Pro    version. In addition, we will work through a simple example project utilizing the    Visual Programming Language 2008 Express environment and a LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT robot    as well as demo a solution for the Sumo robotics challenge from the 2009 Imagine    Cup.</p>
