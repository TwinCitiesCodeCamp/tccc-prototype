<p>    Based on our experience at 3M speeding up numerical processing algorithms for image    processing and ray tracing we will cover topics related to parallel programming    in C/C++ on diverse platforms. By looking at examples using threads, MPI, and OpenMP    on multi-core workstations, high performance computing clusters, and Nvidia GPUs    we will explore some of the issues with programming multiple cores and the performance    gains we have achieved. All the examples will be with Visual Studio 2008 C++ and    Windows.</p>
