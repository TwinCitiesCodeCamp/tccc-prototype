<p>    Silverlight 3 offers new power to developers in being able to work with raw WAV    audio. In this code-heavy session you will see how to produce raw sound wave forms,    work with the sound buffer, and send audio to Silverlight 3. We'll cover topics    such as sequencing, blending, peaks, panning, and how to generate a considerable    amount of annoying noise through your web browser to irritate co-workers.</p>
