<p>    In this session the audience will be introduced to the Spark view engine. The Spark    view engine is an alternative view engine for the ASP.NET MVC and MonoRail frameworks.    The idea of Spark is to allow html to dominate the flow and to allow the code to    fit seamlessly into it. We will delve into creating an ASP.NET MVC app with Spark,    Visual Studio Intellisense integration, and finally wrap things up by unit testing    a Spark view for acceptance testing. To actively participate in this session an    understanding of ASP.NET MVC is advised.</p>
