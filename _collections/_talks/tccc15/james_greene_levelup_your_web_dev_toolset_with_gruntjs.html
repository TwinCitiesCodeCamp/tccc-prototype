<p>    Are you writing JavaScript or CSS for a web application? Maybe you even compile    some CoffeeScript or SASS? Do you concatenate and minify your files? How about linting    them? And you run your unit tests every time you make a change, right? ...RIGHT!?    There's always been a lot of grunt work involved with frontend development but there    have never been great tools for improving your workflow as a developer. That is,    until Node.js came along and completely changed the game in terms of what is possible    to do on the server-side. Come see how GruntJS (a VERY useful Node.js module) can    make your life easier by taking care of most of that grunt work for you! Adhering    to best practices has never been easier. This session will also touch on Node.js,    NPM, PhantomJS, Bower, and more.</p>
