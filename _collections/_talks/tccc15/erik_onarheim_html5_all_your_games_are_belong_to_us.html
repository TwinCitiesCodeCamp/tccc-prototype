<p>    How do you build games in HTML5? In this talk we will learn about the basics of    game development and how to apply it in a canvas based HTML5 game. We will be building    a simple game live on the screen by leveraging JavaScript and new HTML5 features.    We will learn about drawing to the HTML5 canvas, handling key input, maintaining    frame rate, the subtleties of performing rotations and translations, setting up    audio, sprite animations, basic game physics, and multiplayer support! I will also    discuss some lessons in game programming that I learned the hard way so that you    don’t have to. If you are interested in web game development, come learn about everything    you need to make your first game –from the basics to the advanced.</p>
