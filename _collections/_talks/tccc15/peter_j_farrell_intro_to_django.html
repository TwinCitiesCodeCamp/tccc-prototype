<p>    Django is a Python MVC web framework for perfectionists with deadlines. In this    presentation, we'll explore how Django exploits the principle of DRY and the ecosystem    that surrounds Python by building a simple polling application for voting on issues.    Django powers many well-know websites such as Instagram, Pinterest, PBS and Mozilla.    Don't worry if you've never used Python before... you'll be surprised how productive    you can be in Python with little knowledge.</p>
