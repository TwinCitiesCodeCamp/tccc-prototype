<p>    Learn real world techniques for improving your productivity as a developer. We'll    skip past the hype that it's impossible to measure an individual developer or a    team's productivity and jump right into the meat of learning how to tweak your personal    and team development processes to deliver more value to your clients. This session    will take a look at practices to help you improve, processes, and tools - everything    from automating your app deployment to using a clipboard manager. As one of the    best ways of finding new productivity tweaks is working with other developers, we'll    also gather suggestions from the audience on what works in the wild.</p>
