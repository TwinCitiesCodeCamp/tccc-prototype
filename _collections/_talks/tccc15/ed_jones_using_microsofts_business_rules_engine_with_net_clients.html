<p>    One common misconception regarding Microsoft’s Business Rules Engine (BRE) is that    you need BizTalk to use it. Actually, you can call the Rules Engine from any .NET    code. In this session, we’ll show you how to create a policy in the Business Rules    Composer, deploy it to the Rules Engine, and then use Plain Old C# Objects (POCOs)    to execute it. We’ll also include a very brief overview of BizTalk 2013 and how    the BRE works. The demos will use Visual Studio 2012 and the BizTalk 2013 Business    Rules Engine.</p>
