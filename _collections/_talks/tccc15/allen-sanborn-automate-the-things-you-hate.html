<p>    Spend more time coding and less time dealing with environments, builds, configuration,    creating documentation, testing and talking to people you don't like by creating    tools that support the development process and help you leave at 5PM. We spend all    day creating tools that help the business be more efficient so why don't we create    tools that allow us to be more efficient? Come and learn a bit about how to automate    the configuration of environments (DEV to PROD), wrangle your builds/deployments    and automate ALL THE THINGS from a .Net/Windows perspective. Tools = { .Net, PowerShell,    Psake, Nuget, Chocolatey, Boxstarter, TFS 2013 Build-Deploy-Test, TFS Deployer,    Virtual Machines }</p>
