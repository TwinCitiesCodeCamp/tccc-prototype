<p>    D3.js is a powerful framework for data visualization. However, when all you need    is a nice looking javascript bar chart, the idea of learning enough D3 get the job    done can be a bit overwhelming. When you stumble upon your first charting library    built on D3.js, you might feel relieved, but when you stumble upon your fifth, you    are probably back to being overwhelmed. This talk will go through some of these    alternatives and help you understand what the differences are between them so you    can decide what makes the most sense for your needs.</p>
