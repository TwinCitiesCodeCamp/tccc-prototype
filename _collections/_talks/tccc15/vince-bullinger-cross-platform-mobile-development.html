<p>    Mobile development is big and it’s only going to get bigger. You want your app to    work on all major mobile platforms, but not everyone has the time, resources or    even the desire to learn all of the native mobile frameworks. In this presentation,    we’ll learn about how you can make mobile apps that work across all major mobile    platforms without learning several entirely new tech stacks by utilizing cross-platform    mobile development. We’ll go over some of the most popular cross-platform mobile    development frameworks, discuss when to use them vs. native development and when    to use each framework.</p>
