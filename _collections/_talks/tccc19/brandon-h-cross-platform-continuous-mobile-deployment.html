<p>	Agile is all about the continuous cycle of development and feedback solicitation but mobile platforms introduce added complexity: how do you get your app out to all your testers or stakeholders across all the platforms so they can give you the feedback you need to refine it? In this session weâ€™ll explore one way to do this across all the major platforms: Windows 10, iOS, and Android and throw in cross-platform Continuous Integration to boot!</p>
