<p>	Programmer's rejoice!  Don't settle by filling your games with hastily drawn MS Paint scribbles.  Learn how to quickly, easily, and cheaply build voxel art, a blocky 3D art style popularized in games such as Minecraft and Crossy Road.  We'll look at the basic building blocks (pun intended) of creating models in Qubicle (<a href="http://qubicle-constructor.com" target="_blank">http://qubicle-constructor.com</a>) a 3D voxel art editor.  Then we'll apply basic animation techniques using the freely available Blender (<a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">https://www.blender.org/</a>) software package and finish it up by getting that art up and running in a scene within Unity (<a href="http://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">http://unity3d.com/</a>).</p>
