<p>	Maybe you've watched a few videos about Vagrant, Puppet, Docker,	RabbitMQ, or Gradle. You know they represent the future, but you're not	sure why to use them, how to apply them, or how they work together. Join	Dan as he briefly explains the DevOps movement, and then demonstrates	real-world usage of DevOps tools.</p>
