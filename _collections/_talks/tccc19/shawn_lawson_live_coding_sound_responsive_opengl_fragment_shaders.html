<p>	This presentation will be an introduction/crash course into using OpenGL Fragment Shaders for live-coding graphics. I will be using an open source toolkit, The Force, designed around WebGL and run in Google Chrome or Firefox. The toolkit is hosted on github, so participants have the option of following along. <a href="http://shawnlawson.github.io/The_Force/" target="_blank">http://shawnlawson.github.io/The_Force/</a></p><p>	We will cover: a brief explanation of the tool, how itâ€™s constructed, how it works, a quick tour around the basic functionalities of the OpenGL Fragment Shader language, how to work with coordinate space, function generators within the toolkit, some simple examples, and finally integrating an audio source for creating sound responsive graphics.</p>
