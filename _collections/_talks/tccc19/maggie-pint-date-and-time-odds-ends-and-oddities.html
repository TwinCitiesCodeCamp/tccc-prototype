<p>	Did you know that sometimes midnight doesn't happen? That some years have 53 weeks? That javascript will interpret "2016-01-01" and "01/01/2016" differently? That certain libraries can drastically improve the developer experience with date and time?</p><p>	Date and time is a complicated and under-appreciated problem in programming, but it affects nearly ever application ever made. Using code examples in JavaScript, we will go through the oddities and edge cases of date and time that every developer should take into consideration when writing modern applications. You will come out of this talk feeling more prepared to tackle date and time in your code, no matter what programming language you use.</p>
