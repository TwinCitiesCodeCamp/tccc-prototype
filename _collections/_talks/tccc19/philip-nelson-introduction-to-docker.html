<p>	Find out what all this containerization talk is about, and how you can use this for your development and devops work. We'll focus most on your development workflow with more in depth coverage of multiple container applications running locally, how data is saved, how containers are wired together in a network, how your IDE fits in, and other practical stuff the initial howto articles don't seem to cover. We'll cover how docker fits in with other devops tools, and then we'll end with an overview of the ways these containers can be used in production.</p>
