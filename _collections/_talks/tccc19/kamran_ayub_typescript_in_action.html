<p>	Do you want to learn how to automatically generate strongly-typed Angular services for your Web API? What about Knockout view models that stay synced with your server-side code? In this session, we will walk through a sample application that leverages TypeScript, Angular2, and ASP.NET MVC/Web API. You will learn how TypeScript can help augment your development experience and your existing knowledge as a Javascript developer by adding type safety, OO concepts, and ES6 features to your codebase. If you consider yourself a C# or .NET developer and do Javascript on the side, TypeScript is a great fit for all the paradigms you're used to. If you work in a Linux or Mac world, you’ll still be able to leverage TypeScript with cross-platform tooling. Come and learn something that might help you become more productive and make your applications more robust and less scary to refactor. The speaker recommends watching his previous <a href="https://github.com/kamranayub/presentations/tree/master/demystifying-typescript" target="_blank">TypeScript Demystified</a> talk for a grounding in the concepts of TypeScript but it’s not required.</p>
