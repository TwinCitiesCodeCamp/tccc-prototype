<p>    Readers block writers and writers block readers. You’ve got to write your T-SQL code with that in mind, right?  Not necessarily!  By utilizing the Read Committed Snapshot database option or the Snapshot Isolation level within SQL Server, you can dramatically increase concurrency for your database applications.  After a high level overview of SQL Server isolation levels, we’ll spend the majority of this session discussing the implementation of optimistic concurrency control within SQL Server. We’ll look at the benefits and drawbacks of using an optimistic isolation level and discuss use cases where it may or may not be appropriate. Come learn how to put one of the more powerful, but least understood, aspects of SQL Server to work for you!</p>
