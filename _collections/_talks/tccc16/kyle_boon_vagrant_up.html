<p>    Vagrant is a tool to create and configure development environments in a virtual machine. I'll go over the basics of vagrant plus orchestration tools like chef. I'll also show how Bloom Health uses Vagrant to help developers cope with our growing services based stack. These tools allow developers to focus on writing business logic and not worry about mysql versions and other minutiae.</p>
