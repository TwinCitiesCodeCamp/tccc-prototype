<p>    Whether you're typing out a Subversion log message, a blog post, or an email, sometimes plain text just isn't enough. Join Dan Nordquist for a discussion of Markdown, a language (and program) that enables people to write HTML without the hassle. Learn how to use Markdown, who uses it today, what problems it solves, and how to include it in your projects.</p>
