<p>    Google's Closure Compiler is more than just a run-of-the-mill    JavaScript minifier, it's a whole-program optimizer with a number of    tricks up its sleeve: dead code elimination, inlining, a rich standard    library, and even type-checking. It is, like lots of tools Google    throws over its high ivory walls, a bit intimidating to get started    with, though. This talk will show you how to get up and running with    Closure, how to integrate it into a one-touch build process and the    ins-and-outs of its most useful features. I'll show you what I did to    take a rich, single page app with 456K of JavaScript spread over 123    files and turn it into a single 74K file.</p>
