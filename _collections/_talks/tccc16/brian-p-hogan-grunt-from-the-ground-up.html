<p>    Modern web development requires managing CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and other assets, and things can get out of hand quickly. Grunt has become the standard for managing all of the tasks related to modern development, from concatenating files to minifying files for production. Unfortunately, most documentation on the Web focuses on how to cut and paste configuration files together. That’s not very helpful.</p><p>    In this talk you'll learn how to use Grunt for a variety of purposes as we explore how it all works. We’ll cover how to develop Grunt tasks, how to work with files, how Multitasks work, and how to use Grunt and its plugin system to manage the development of a single page app that uses CoffeeScript, Sass, and Angular.  When we’re done you’ll know exactly how Grunt works so you can use it on your own projects right away.</p>
