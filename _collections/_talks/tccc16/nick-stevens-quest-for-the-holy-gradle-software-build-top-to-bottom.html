<p>    Historically JVM build tools have been locked in the JVM playground - languages other than Java need not apply. Gradle is a blossoming build tool that changes that - providing build capabilities for everything from C to JavaScript, Scala to Java.</p><p>    This session is going to be heavily based on doing: creating a simple project that spans Java, Groovy, JavaScript, and CoffeeScript. I'll show you how to perform all steps of a build and assembly process with a single Gradle command, from a workstation with only the JDK installed.</p>
