<p>    Do you have questions about your web site's performance?  Would you like to have your site reviewed live?  Don't worry, I'm not selling anything, but you'll be selling a lot more when your site is so much faster!  There are many techniques such as HTTP compression, caching with expirations, bundling and minification, image optimization, CDNs, and more that we will review in the context of attendees' real web sites.  We will also discover tools such as Fiddler and Page Speed you can use to diagnose performance on your own.  Ever wanted a free performance review of your web site with tips to improve it, now's your chance!</p>
