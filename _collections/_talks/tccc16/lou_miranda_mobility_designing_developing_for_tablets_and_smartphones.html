<p>    Mobility isn’t just about smartphones anymore. Since the advent of the iPad, four years ago, tablets have sold in the hundreds of millions. Recent studies on consumer spending for the 2013 holiday season demonstrate that much mobile commerce occurs on tablets. And as a productivity device, a tablet can be much more useful than a phone-sized device.</p><p>    But is designing and developing for tablets too difficult? Are there reasonable ways of cutting costs when developing tablet apps? How much visual design and code reuse is there in “universal” apps that run on phones and tablets? How different is a tablet from a laptop, and how different is it from a phone? All this and more will be discussed as we cover one of the leading trends for mobility in 2014.</p>
