<p>    As more and more web applications integrate with third-party APIs and other external    data, processing those external resources in the background more and more important.    A simple job runner is a great start, however as your load increases, you very quickly    outgrew that simplistic queuing system. We will cover where getting started using    Resque and Redis, how to test your jobs, when it makes sense to use Resque, implementations    of Resque in other languages, and look how I've used Resque.</p>
