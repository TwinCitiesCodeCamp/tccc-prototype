<p>    Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a library from Microsoft that allows you to write LINQ    queries to compose events and asynchronous operations into simple yet powerful constructs.    Rx is packed with useful functionality that allows you to get a lot done with very    little effort. This session will go over some common Rx functions, like Throttle    and Zip, and demonstrate how easily they can be combined with various events to    enable you to create superior user experiences.</p>
