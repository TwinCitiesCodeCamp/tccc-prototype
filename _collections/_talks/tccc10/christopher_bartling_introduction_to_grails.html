<p>    Grails is an advanced and innovative open source web application platform that delivers    new levels of developer productivity by applying principles like Convention over    Configuration. Grails naturally complements Java application development since it    is built on Spring and based on Groovy, a dynamic language for the Java platform.    This session will start with a brief overview of the exciting Grails web application    framework. Topics covered include the structure of a Grails application, data querying    and persistence, validation, controllers, Groovy Server Pages (GSPs) and tag libraries.    The second part of the session will be a hands-on demonstration, showing the agility    and speed of development that the Grails framework is known for.</p>
