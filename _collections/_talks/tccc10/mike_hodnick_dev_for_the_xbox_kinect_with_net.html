<p>    The XBox Kinect device has become just as popular among programmers as it has among    gamers. From air-guitar apps to user interfaces that resemble scenes from the movie    Minority Report, programmers have been creating unique and innovative apps with    the Kinect since it was released in late 2010. In this session we'll talk about    how to develop Kinect-based apps for Windows 7 with managed .NET code. The session    will cover the foundations of what you need to build Kinect apps such as drivers,    libraries, detecting and focusing on a user, hand tracking, and simple gestures    such as swiping and pushing. We'll also get in to applying these concepts to Windows    technologies such as WPF and show live examples of Kinect being used in real apps    for real-world scenarios.</p>
