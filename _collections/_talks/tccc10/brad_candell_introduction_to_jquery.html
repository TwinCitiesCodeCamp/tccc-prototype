<p>    jQuery is an extremely popular and fast growing Javascript Library that focuses    on cross-browser support and simplifying the act of writing client-side scripting.    This small Javascript library packs a big punch for HTML developers looking to add    increased client-side functionality to their web sites. jQuery features simple HTML    DOM element selection and traversal, event binding, CSS manipulations, animation,    and AJAX functionality. jQuery also boasts an extensibility aspect with a very large    implementation base. You can easily find a jQuery library to achieve many different    web functions that you may already be looking for. This presentation will focus    on getting you started with jQuery development and how you can use it with HTML,    CSS, and Images to create some very neat effects with relatively little effort.</p>
