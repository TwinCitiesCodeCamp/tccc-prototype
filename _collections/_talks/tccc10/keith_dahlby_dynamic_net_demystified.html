<p>    It's been a year since dynamic .NET went mainstream with the promotion of the Dynamic    Language Runtime into .NET 4. This session will review what the DLR is, dive into    how it works with C# 4 and Visual Basic 10, and look at some interesting applications    of the DLR. In particular we'll discuss Clay, a dynamic library used by Microsoft's    Orchard CMS; C# interop with IronPython; and simplified data access through Microsoft.Data,    Simple.Data and Rob Conery's Massive.</p>
