<p>    Server monitoring can be expensive and is generally licensed for only critical production    servers. In this session, learn how to utilize Powershell along with SMO to not    only be proactive, but productive in monitoring the servers in your environment.    Attendees will come away from the session with an understanding of how to check    a server's health and collect performance metrics. This will be useful for general    monitoring in your environment and can also be used for collecting data in a physical    to virtual migration. The session will include a brief introduction and focus on    working through demos of proven scripts you can utilize right away.</p>
