<p>    For many of us, writing code isn't just what we do for money; it's something we    love to do and share with others. One of the best ways to share that passion is    through writing. In this talk, we'll explore the world of writing and publishing    content for programmers. We'll explore the writing and editorial processes, including    how to really connect with your audience, and we'll go over some tools and techniques    you can use to organize your writing and produce something real, useful, and unique.    Finally, we'll talk about what it takes to make a great book proposal and what it    takes to get the word out about your writing.
