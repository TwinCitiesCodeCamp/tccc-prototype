<p>    Leverage your existing skills to build native applications for the PlayBook using    WebWorks, Java or Adobe AIR. In this session we'll size up the PlayBook to the competition    and cover everything you'll need to get started with the BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK.    We'll build an application from scratch, test using the PlayBook simulator and walk    through the steps for submitting to the BlackBerry App World. To conclude, we'll    cross compile our application to run naively on Android devices without any change    in code!</p>
