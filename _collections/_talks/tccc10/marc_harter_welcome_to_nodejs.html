<p>    NodeJS is a Server Side JavaScript (SSJS) implementation built off the Google Chrome    V8 JavaScript engine. It is grown considerably in popularity since its initial public    release a little over a year ago. Some have called 2011, the "Year of Server Side    JavaScript." Why? Is it just a fad? What does it offer different from other server    side languages and frameworks? What makes it stand out? In this talk, we will be    discussing the answers to those questions as we look at design philosophy behind    NodeJS. We will also look into its implementation and some demo applications. The    goal is for you to come away with a clear understanding of what NodeJS is, what    problems it tries to solve, and how it could be used in your application stack.</p>
