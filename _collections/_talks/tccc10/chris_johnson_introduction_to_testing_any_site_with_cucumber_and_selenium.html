<p>    Do you have a website? Do you have any tests for that site? Even if you have unit    tests integration tests can help you target workflows such as a checkout process.    In this presentation I will talk about testing any site with Cucumber and Selenium.    I will show what the tests look like, and explain the different ways to run these    tests, from running them locally, building your own selenium grid to using Sauce    labs as your testing infrastructure.</p>
