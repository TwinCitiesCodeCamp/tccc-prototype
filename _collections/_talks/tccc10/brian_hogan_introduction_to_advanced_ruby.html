<p>    "Introduction to Ruby" talks aren't that exciting. Every language has strings, arrays,    conditionals, and evaluation, and by now, everyone's sick of "build a CRUD app in    15 minutes" demos. Every language has its own special qualities that set it apart,    and this talk focuses what makes Ruby different and special. We'll cover seven advanced    language features and techniques, and we'll demonstrate how we use those to solve    everyday problems. We'll talk about message passing, extending core language features,    lambdas, and we'll even write a little code that writes code. If you've looked at    Ruby and thought "What's the point?" then this talk is for you.</p>
