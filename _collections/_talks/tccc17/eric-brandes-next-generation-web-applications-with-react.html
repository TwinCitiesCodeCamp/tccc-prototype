<p>    Client side frameworks like Angular, Knockout, and Ember rely on two-way data binding to keep view and model in sync. Two-way binding works great at first, but quickly breaks down as all the complex interactions make reasoning about the state of the application impossible.  And, if you're not careful, you'll be thrashing the DOM and killing performance to boot.</p><p>    React is a JavaScript framework that takes a different approach.  It uses a "unidirectional" data flow to keep state transitions explicit and rendering lightning fast.  In this talk we'll see how a virtual DOM, new markup syntax, and some ideas from the functional programming world combine to make a great client side framework.  Come see why you should write your next web application using React!</p>
