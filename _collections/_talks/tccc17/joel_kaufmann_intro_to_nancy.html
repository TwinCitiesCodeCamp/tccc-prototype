<p>    In this session weâ€™ll take a look at the alternative .NET web framework Nancy, which is based on the Ruby library Sinatra. Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .NET. The goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super-duper-happy-path to all interactions.</p>
