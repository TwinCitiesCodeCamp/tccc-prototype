<p>    With all of the maturing configuration frameworks available (Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and others), what can you accomplish with pre-packaged containers such as Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk?</p><p>    This talk will explore exactly what is provided with this Elastic Beanstalk for load-balanced multi-node server farms, both web and worker roles - and how multiple environments, configuration, health check, and rolling upgrades are all handled.</p><p>    In addition, we'll talk about how one team used Github, Jenkins, and Elastic Beanstalk to create continuous delivery pipelines for a set of related applications across multiple environments.</p><p>    Finally, we'll talk pitfalls and gotchyas - and why you might prefer to deploy via fully scripted goodness.</p>
