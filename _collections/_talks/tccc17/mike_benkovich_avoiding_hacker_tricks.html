<p>    Are you afraid? Should you be? Computer hacking isn’t a new thing, but the threat remains. In this attackers advantage and a defenders dilemma, how do you keep your data and secrets safe? Today’s ever changing technology landscape means that the fundamentals of writing secure code are more important than ever. In this session we take a look at the secure development approach and go thru the top exploits that you need to know about. We'll show how you can use .NET features to stop exploits before they happen. You don’t want to be at the center of the next media frenzy over lost data and compromised records, or lose your customers confidence and trust in how you do business.  From injection attacks and cross site scripting to security misconfiguration we look at the hacker's psyche and show how they think and work, and learn what we can do to build more secure software.</p>
