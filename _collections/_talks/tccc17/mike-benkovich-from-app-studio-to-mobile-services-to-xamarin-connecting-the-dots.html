<p>    The only thing that’s constant is change, and nowhere is that more true than in mobile technology. New phones, tablets and phablets mean new opportunities for developers to create great ways of connecting people and the data. In this session we’ll explore how you can go cross platform with data, identity and services to create the ultimate connected experience. From creating a quick start application with App Studio to connecting it with Mobile Services data and identity, to delivering it across platforms we will show you how to build applications that share data and identity, and connect it all with the cloud.</p>
