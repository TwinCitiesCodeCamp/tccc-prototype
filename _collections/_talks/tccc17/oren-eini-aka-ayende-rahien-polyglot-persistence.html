<p>    Today's world doesn't allow us to think in just one way. We have already learned that when we run into the limitations of the relational world. Document databases aren't suited for every category either, but in this talk, we'll explore the polyglot persistence option. A single database that provide multiple persistence options. Among those that will be shown are: distributed counters, event aggregation, and time series databases. All tailored specifically for their single task.</p>
