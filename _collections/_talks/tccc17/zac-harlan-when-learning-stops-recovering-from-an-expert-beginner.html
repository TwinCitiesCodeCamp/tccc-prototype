<p>    “We’re too busy to write tests.” “I played around with [new thing], but only [current thing] will work for this team.” “That’s just not how we do things here.” You’ve heard it before, and you’ll hear it again. The specifics will vary, but ultimately some professionals just choose to stop learning.</p><p>    This session will explore this “Expert Beginner” behavior with first-person examples: how to recognize it, how it happens, and how it impacts a team and the business around them. More importantly, we’ll discuss the recovery strategies we’re still using to reignite the development team, rebuild our stakeholders’ trust, and make up for lost time.</p>
