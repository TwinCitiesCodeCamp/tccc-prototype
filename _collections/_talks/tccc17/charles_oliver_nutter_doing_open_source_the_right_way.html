<p>    Have you ever used an open source project? Well of course you have,    but how about contributed to one? Filed a bug report? Submitted a    patch? Have you ever started your own OSS project, or taken a    closed/private project public? What licenses should you use? How do    you manage contributions? How do you encourage contributors and get    work done? In this talk we'll go over the basics of OSS: how to get    involved, how to start a project, how to manage contributions. We'll    discuss project lifecycles, legal CYA tips, and how to keep projects    moving. You'll see the inner workings of real OSS projects, and learn    how to be a better OSS user and producer.</p>
