<p>    Remember that time you wrote your own authentication framework, or that cool logging/tracing library that you were sure would impress your co-workers?  Although "NIH" may not be as prevalent as it used to be, we'll talk through free and low-cost alternatives to those last few aspects of your application that should really be leveraging existing libraries and services.  Logging, fault reporting, authentication and more.</p>
