<p>    Our ability to accurately estimate the software development process might be more    important than our ability to actually write code. Estimation can be both art and    science, but a lot of developers don't even know where to begin. Poor estimates    can lead to missed deadlines, lost opportunities, and a lack of trust between management    and developers. This conversational presentation (light on code) will help you avoid    the common pitfalls of project estimation. You'll leave armed with smarter estimation    techniques and more accurate ways to communicate what's going to happen and when.</p>
