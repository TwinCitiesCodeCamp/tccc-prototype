<p>    In this session, Kenny will delve into the basic requirements for you to get started    with Android development. This will include covering the architecture of the Android    operating system as well as some ins-and-outs of Android mobile development, starting    with the basic install (Eclipse and Android SDK) and ending with publishing to the    Android Marketplace. A general understanding of the Java language is advised but    not required.</p>
