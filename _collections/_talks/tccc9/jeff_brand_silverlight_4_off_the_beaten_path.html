<p>    This session will look at some of the less talked about new features in Silverlight    4. Features that have typically been bullet points on a slide titled "What's New    in Silverlight 4" will be explored in more detail. We will look at things like printing,    application lifecycle, custom chrome, notifications, a dash of Blend goodness, and    more.</p>
