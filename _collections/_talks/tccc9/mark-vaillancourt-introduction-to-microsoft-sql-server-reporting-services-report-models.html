<p>    Report Models can be a great way to empower your end users to create their own reports    through a drag and drop tool. This presentation will discuss how to create, maintain    and secure SSRS Report Models. Although the focus is on implementation, we will    use Report Builder 3.0 to demonstrate report model consumption. We will also cover    some tips and tricks learned through real-world experience implementing and supporting    report models for clients.</p>
