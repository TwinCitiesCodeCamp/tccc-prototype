<p>    Version control is one of the most critical tools developers use: from keeping files    safe, to tracking revisions, to enabling effective collaboration. Often, a VCS is    selected on the basis of what is easily available or has previously been used; without    consideration for the needs of the developers, how well it protects the work they    create, or how it helps them work more effectively.</p><p>    This session will cover the types of version control systems that are available,    their strengths and weaknesses, and how to use them effectively; it will focus,    in particular, on distributed version control systems, how they differ from centralized    systems, and what is significant about those differences</p>
