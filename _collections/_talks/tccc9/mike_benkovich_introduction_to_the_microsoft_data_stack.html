<p>    Data is the core of why we build systems and solutions and look for opportunities    to automate and simplify. What are the options and when do you make tradeoffs? In    this session we'll take a look at what's new with the ADO.NET Entity Framework and    how it fits into working with WCF, REST and RIA based services. We will explore    the technologies and the trends that are driving it to see where Microsoft is going    related to data.</p>
