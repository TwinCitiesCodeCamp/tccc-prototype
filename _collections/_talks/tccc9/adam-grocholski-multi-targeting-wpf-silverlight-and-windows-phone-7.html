<p>    With WPF, Silverlight, and now Windows Phone 7, all using xaml, multi-targeting    applications can be a reality. However, it's not without its challenges. In this    session I'll talk about which things are easiest to share, and which are hardest.    I'll also show you some recommended approaches on how to structure your project,    as well as a comparison of the different ways by which you can share code and xaml.    I'll cover topics such as assembly portability, code sharing using linked files,    usercontrol encapsulation and abstraction, and even loading xaml at runtime after    tinkering with the source via code.</p>
