<p>    Out-of-browser, network detection, microphone, webcam, GO! In this session we'll    build a Silverlight application that captures media from your computer's webcam    and microphone and then uses network detection to determine when it's ok to upload    the data "somewhere". We'll cover the ins, outs, and "gotchas" of the API that detects    an internet connection as well as what it means to run "out of browser". We'll also    dig in to the capture API, learn how to connect to a computer's webcam and microphone,    and also record some real data from those devices.</p>
