<p>    Axum is a programming language launched as an incubation project within Microsoft    DevLabs. Unlike traditional object-oriented languages, Axum is an actor-oriented    language that uses principles of isolation, actors, and message-passing to increase    application safety, responsiveness, scalability, and developer productivity. This    presentation will include a walkthrough of small sample applications written in    Axum for Visual Studio 2010 that offers an overview of the Axum language.</p>
