<p>    Beyond the massive hype of Ruby on Rails, there's an amazing world of frameworks,    DSLs, and libraries that make the Ruby language a compelling choice when working    on the web. In this talk, you'll get a chance to see how to use Ruby to quickly    build a static web site, create complex stylesheets with ease, build a simple web    service, crete a simple Websocket server, and test your existing applications. Finally,    you'll see a few of the ways Rails really can make developing complex applications    easier, from advanced database querying to rendering views in multiple formats.</p>
