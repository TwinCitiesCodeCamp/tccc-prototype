<p>    Service Oriented Architecture is the next inevitable communication paradigm for    the simple reasons of cost effectiveness through higher visibility and efficiency    in terms of maintainability and scalability. Windows Communication Foundation, WCF,    is Microsoft's comprehensive framework toward that end. In this session we'll analyze    and discuss the fundamental mechanics behind developing (including migrating existing    libraries to) WCF service libraries, hosting the libraries, and consuming them.    We'll analyze all three of these aspects in some detail from existing underlying    object models to extending parts of the framework to support varying consumer needs.    We'll identify and highlight the inner workings of Windows Communication Foundation    to get the most of what the framework has to offer.</p>
