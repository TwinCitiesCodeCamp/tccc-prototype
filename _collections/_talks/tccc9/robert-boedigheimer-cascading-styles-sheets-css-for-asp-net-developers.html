<p>    Do you still use tables to layout your user interface? Do you still use the &lt;font&gt;    tag or have presentation information scattered throughout your markup? Learn how    to leverage CSS to separate your content and presentation, and the many benfits    it provides. Review selectors, inheritance, and grouping. Learn common techniques    for providing for a flexible layout and design that can be modified easily later.    Discover the media attribute to target different styles for screen and print. Review    the new CSS 3 improvements, and what browsers support them. See how to maximize    performance when using CSS via proper use of HTTP compression, minification, and    expirations.</p>
