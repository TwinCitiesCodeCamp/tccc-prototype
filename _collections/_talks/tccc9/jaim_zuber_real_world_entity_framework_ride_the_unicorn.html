<p>    Entity Framework Version 1 was released with .NET 3.5 SP1 with much fanfare and    significant criticism from the development community. Version 2 with .NET 4.0 addressed    many of these critiques but concerns for it's current viability remain. This session    will go over some real world applications and show how Entity Framework made our    job - and lives - easier. This will include patterns considered for Orbject Relational    Mapping (ORM), pitfalls to avoid, lessons learned and why Entity Framework was used    over other ORM options.</p>
