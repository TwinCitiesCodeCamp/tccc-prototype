<p>    With the release of the 4.0 version of the .NET Framework and Visual Studio 2010,    there's a lot to take in. In this talk, we'll narrow the focus to the additions    to the Base Class Library (BCL), which includes tuples, numerics, I/O, parsing,    collections, and other various goodies.</p>
