<p>    CSLA .NET is one of the most widely used .NET development frameworks, and it was    the first major framework to support Silverlight. Learn how to build powerful applications    in Silverlight by leveraging all the great capabilities provided by the newest version    of the framework: CSLA 4. This session will show you how to build rich business    domain objects that run on your Silverlight client and application/web server, as    well as how to use the MVVM design pattern to build the Silverlight UI with absolutely    no code behind the XAML views.</p>
