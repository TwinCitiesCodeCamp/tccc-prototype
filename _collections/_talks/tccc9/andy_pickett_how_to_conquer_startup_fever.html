<p>    Most of us developers have that bug, you know the one, the itch, the drive to create,    to start something. But, the inertia of the couch is sometimes just too much to    overcome. We've got the skill and the ideas, but sometimes we just need a kick.    One terrific kick is Startup Weekend (Nov 19-21, go sign up ,we'll wait). In this    session Andy Pickett describes how Startup Weekend provided that launch pad and    just enough boost for his teammates to get something real off the ground. That something    is QONQR, the GeoSocial Game of World Domination! This session will be 1 part code,    1 part business, 1 part game theory, and 100% awesome. We'll walk through the process    of the startup from pitch to design to alpha to beta and beyond. It will include    a tour through the (3 week old) codebase that is QONQR (including a Mobile Web front    end using ASP.Net MVC 2 and jQuery, a Tactical Command Center written in Silverlight,    and SQL Server back end). Hopefully this will just be a fun, maybe inspiring conversation    about getting something started. There will be absolutely no best practices or patterns    displayed, as well as no legally binding business advice of any kind, this much    we promise you.</p>
