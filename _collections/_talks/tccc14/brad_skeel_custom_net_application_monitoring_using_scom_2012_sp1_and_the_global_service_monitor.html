<p>    With the release of System Center Operations Manager 2012 SP1, one of the major    focus areas has been increased ability to monitor .NET applications. If a company    is heavily invested in custom application development, monitoring and getting issues    quickly into the hands of developers is key to overall successful customer experience.    SCOM 2012 SP1 extends the reach of .NET application monitoring, and with the addition    of the Global Service Monitor, extends that reach outside the data center to the    cloud via Windows Azure. This presentation focuses on the .NET application monitoring    aspects of SCOM 2012 SP1 and shows the Global Service Monitor tool monitoring a    standard .NET application.</p>
