<p>    Service Bus has been known for several years as one of the capabilities only available    in Azure. There was also no complete engine to run persistent workflows for "cloud    scale". Aligned with the release of SharePoint 2013, Microsoft brought Service Bus    "OnPremise" and developed a new Workflow Engine that will drive many, if not most    future iterations of Microsoft products requiring any type of workflow or messaging.    Now everybody has access to those. Both technologies are available now free to use    in your own applications or solutions. This talk will introduce those to .NET Developers    and demo how to use them.</p>
