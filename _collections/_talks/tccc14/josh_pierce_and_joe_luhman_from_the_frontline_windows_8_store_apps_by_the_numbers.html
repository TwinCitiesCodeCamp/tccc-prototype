<p>    This talk, presented by See Sharp Guys, will provide real-world numbers from an    independent development team focusing on building applications for the last frontier    in app stores: the Windows 8 Store. The Google Play store has the largest install    base, and iOS undoubtedly generates the most revenues. But for developers looking    for a new opportunity, can the Windows 8 store offer opportunities the established    players can't? During this talk, we will demonstrate how it's still early days in    the Windows 8 store, and now is the time to get your app in the store and capitalize    on this new and growing market. We will cover what we have seen by having a top    10 app, a top 100 app, and a low-tier app in the store at the same time. During    the second portion of our talk, we will do a 'deep dive' and look at analytics of    user behavior inside mobile applications, what metrics drive revenues, and how you    can capture metrics in your app (whether on Windows, Android or iOS) to increase    your revenues too.</p>
