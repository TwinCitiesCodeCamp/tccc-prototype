<p>    Developers usually leave documentation as a final step; one that they will get to    as soon as they are forced with threats of bodily harm. Writing the documentation    before writing the code, can lead to better code, better implementation and, of    course, actual documentation. This talk isn't just about philosophy. It covers actual    experiences and contains practical tips and solutions to get started. Discover how    easy it is to write down your ideas and iteratively develop the documentation. Learn    some of the tools to use to make your documentation look great. Find out that writing    things down doesn't have to be a chore, but can be liberating, and helpful when    working with non-technical people.</p>
