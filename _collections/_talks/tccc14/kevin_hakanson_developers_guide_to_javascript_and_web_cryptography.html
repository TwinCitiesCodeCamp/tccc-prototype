<p>    The increasing capabilities and performance of the web platform allow for more feature-rich    user experiences. How can JavaScript based applications utilize information security    and cryptography principles? This session will explore the current state of JavaScript    and Web Cryptography. We will review some basic concepts and definitions, discuss    the role of TLS/SSL, show some working examples that apply cryptography to real-world    use cases and take a peek at the upcoming W3C WebCryptoAPI. Code samples will use    CryptoJS in the browser and the Node.js Crypto module on the server. An extended    example will secure the popular TodoMVC project using PBKDF2 for key generation,    HMAC for data integrity and AES for encryption.</p>
