<p>    Sprache is a powerful .NET library to enable .NET developers to quickly implement    text parsers. In this talk, Jordan will show you the basics of using Sprache, how    to build a simple Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to contain the parse results, an example    of a simple end-to-end Domain Specific Language (DSL), and some of the extensible    points of the Sprache library.</p>
