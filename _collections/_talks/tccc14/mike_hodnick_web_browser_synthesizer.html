<p>    Build extraordinary audio applications in JavaScript with audiolib.js. In this session    you'll learn how to turn your web browser into a mind-bending, cat-annoying, audio-producing    machine. Leave your HTML &lt;audio&gt; elements at home kids - in this presentation    we look at the API's that make digital audio synthesis possible with JavaScript.    Specifically, we will dive in to audiolib.js - an open source JavaScript library    that wraps browser-specific API's. We'll discover basics such as oscillators, LFO's,    samplers, and using effects like reverb and delay. We'll also dig in to more complex    topics such as envelopes, custom synth instruments, custom effects, and building    a sequencer in your browser.</p>
