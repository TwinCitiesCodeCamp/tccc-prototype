<p>    We've all heard of Biz Talk, but not many of us truly understand what Biz Talk is    and how it fits into a larger solution. In this session we'll take a tour of the    features of Biz Talk and give attendees a good starting point to learn more about    the product and how it might play into their solution plans.</p>
