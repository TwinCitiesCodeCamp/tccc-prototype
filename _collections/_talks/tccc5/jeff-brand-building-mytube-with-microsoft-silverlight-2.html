<p>    In this session, we will look at using Microsoft Silverlight and Silverlight Streaming    to build your very own online television station. The session will show how to encode    and host video on Silverlight Streaming, build a online media player using Silverlight    including how to design and develop the experience using Visual Studio and Expression    Blend. It will also look at using web services to provide data to the media player    to show a video catalog.</p>
