<p>    Learn about aspect-oriented design patterns and how they can be used to quickly    add common functionality to your business objects. Aspect-oriented programming allows    for the separation of true business logic and the code written allowing interaction    with user interfaces. The Core framework is a generation model that dynamically    adds common services, such as logging, auditing, persistence, and security to business    objects. Aspects, or behaviors, are requested using attributes or configuration    files which allows services to be included only where necessary eliminating overly    bloated objects; tailored for the environment into which the object is loaded.</p>
