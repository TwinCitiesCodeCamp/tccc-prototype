<p>    <a href="http://www.jasonbock.net/JB/Code/ExceptionalDevelopment.zip">        Presentation        Materials    </a></p><p>    .NET provides a rich mechanism for creating and handling errors in software. Yet    it can be (and has been) abused and manipuated (sometimes in very subtle ways) in    the name of "reliable code." In this session we'll cover exceptions: how they are    created, when should they be handled, and what are some best practices to follow.</p>
