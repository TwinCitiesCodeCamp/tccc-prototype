<p>    If you are thinking, "What the hell is PICK?", you are not alone. This Database/Runtime/Operating    System has been around for over 40 years and is still going strong. Many companies    don't realize what they are running, only that it has served them well for decades.    Companies like IBM are bringing the system into a new age with U2. This session    will cover the fundamentals of PICK, how data is stored, accessed and manipulated.    This system is seeing it's features resurge these days in the form of Multivalue    columns in Access 2007 and CLR in SQL Server. Join in on learning the fun and pain    of developing in this widespread but often forgotten system.</p>
