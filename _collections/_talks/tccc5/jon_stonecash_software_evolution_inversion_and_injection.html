<p>    <a href="http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/archive/2008/10/14/Twin-Cities-Code-Camp-Code-and-Presentation-and-Notes.aspx">        Presentation Materials    </a></p><p>    Useful software evolves and adapts to changing needs. This continuing change cannot    happen if the software design and implementation is riddled with dependencies: A    change to module A triggers changes in B and C, that collectively, trigger more    changes in D, E, F, and G and so on until the software explodes. This sounds like    a terrific special-effects movie but a very bad information technology experience.    There are design practices that build "fire walls" that isolate one part of the    software from other parts, but ultimately the question becomes, how can one part    of the software invoke the services of another part without becoming dependent on    that other part? This sounds very much like a Zen riddle: "What is the sound of    one hand clapping?"</p><p>    Enter the twin concepts of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection. With Inversion    of Control, when a particular module of the software is dependent upon a particular    service, say logging, that dependency is abstracted down to an interface. Any invocation    of the logging function is made against the interface. Before the module can execute,    it must obtain a reference to an object that implements the interface. There are    a lot of ways to accomplish this: 1) passing the reference as a part of instantiating    or invoking the functions of the module, 2) returning the reference from a factory    method, and 3) injecting the dependency reference as part of a Dependency Injection    framework.</p><p>    We will look the design patterns for Inversion of Control and demonstrate code that    uses the following Dependency Injection frameworks:</p><ul>    <li>Castle Windsor</li>    <li>StructureMap</li>    <li>Unity</li>    <li>Spring.NET</li></ul>
