<p>    Presentation Materials - <a href="http://www.insidegamer.org/documents/Lights%20with%20HLSL.ppt">        Slides    </a> and <a href="http://www.insidegamer.org/documents/TCCCCode.zip">Code</a></p><p>    The basics of Microsoft's high-level shading language (HLSL) are introduced, including    a basic overview of the rendering pipeline, through the creation of a point light    shader. HLSL allows graphics programmers to create realistic graphics through the    use of a combination of math algorithms and the hardware they are processed on.    Around the time of DirectX 8, shaders were implemented to allow changes per geometric    shape, vertex, and pixel during a frame render. As one of the items comes to render    on the graphics device, the math algorithm written into the shader file is applied    to the respective object and is rendered to the screen. Current technology has reached    the point where shaders are a necessity for any graphics developer, considering    graphics libraries such as Microsoft's XNA have removed support for a non-programmed,    â€˜fixed' graphics pipeline. A simple shader is built to emulate a point light while    each step includes reasoning behind the code and relevance to the theory of a point    light. A conclusion is given explaining other uses for shaders.</p>
