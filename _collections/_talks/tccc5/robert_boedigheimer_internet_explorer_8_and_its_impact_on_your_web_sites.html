<p>    <a href="http://aspadvice.com/blogs/robertb/archive/2008/10/21/Twin-Cities-Code-Camp-Fall-2008-Handouts.aspx">        Presentation Material    </a></p><p>    Internet Explorer 8 will ship in a new "standards" mode by default, which has the    potential to impact many sites that have been crafted around various "features"    in past versions. Learn which current practices will need to change and how this    will affect your development techniques and your existing sites. Review tools that    will be built into the browser to help developers debug and create web pages. Web    Slices are a new feature that allow developers to mark areas of web pages that users    can subscribe to like RSS feeds to wach for updates to those slices. Don't be surprised    the day IE 8 ships and your sites break, be prepared!</p>
