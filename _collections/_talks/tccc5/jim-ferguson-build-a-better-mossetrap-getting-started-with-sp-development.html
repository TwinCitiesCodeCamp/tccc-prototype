<p>    So you've been messing around with SharePoint for a while and have had the MOSS    Epiphany that there is room for improvement, and being a developer you are thinking    "I bet I can build that better MOSS solution and make a million bucks," but are    not certain how to get started or what to watch out for...Carpe Dev-em! In this    session we will spend a bit of time on Tools of the Trade, then move into development,    gotchas (lessons learned from writing the SSPSCOPEDEPLOY tool), and time permitting    look at deployment and packaging.</p>
