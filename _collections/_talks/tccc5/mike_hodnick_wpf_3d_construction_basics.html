<p>    Microsoft's WPF platform provides the ability to create 3D scenes in Windows desktop    applications. In this session you'll learn the basics of building and viewing 3D    scenes in WPF. With a touch of 3D theory, we will drill into the .NET classes and    XAML used to construct 3D meshes and models. You'll also see a real app render an    interactive 3D scene from real data, and we'll talk about tools available to make    WPF 3D development easier.</p>
