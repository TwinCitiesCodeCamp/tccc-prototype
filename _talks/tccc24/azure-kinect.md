Azure Kinect DK and the Azure IoT AI Camera are two of the most advanced Computer Vision devices available for developers today! <strong>Combining</strong> advanced depth sensor, spatial microphone array, video cameras with sophisticated computer vision <em>and speech AI models</em>, the Kinect is gives us an unparalleled tool for building cutting edge computer vision applications. We'll specifically be diving into the Kinect's Body Tracking SDK - allowing for amazing kinematic and movement tracking. Think of the possibilities in Sports, Health and the <span style="color: red;">Life Sciences fields</span>
-- as well as Games and other amazing user experiences! Join Lance Larsen (Microsoft MVP) in looking how to start building your next computer vision application today!
