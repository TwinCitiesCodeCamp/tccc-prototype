What am I doing here? All these people are so much smarter than me. They’ll find out I have no idea what I’m talking about. Why did they even let me do this in the first place? I should’ve just stayed at my last job. Sure, I hated it, but I knew how to do it. Sound familiar? You might have Imposter Syndrome. Imposter Syndrome is a very, very common issue that a lot of us face. In the ever-growing world of tech, it sometimes seems difficult to both get and keep up to speed on what’s going on in your company. Especially for those of us that are career-changers, the task sometimes seems even more daunting. In this workshop, we’ll examine Imposter Syndrome and learn how to nip it in the bud! We’ll learn techniques for recognizing and squashing those imposter-y feelings before you let it take over your life and career.
