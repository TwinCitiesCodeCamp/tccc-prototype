I'm a Sr. Security Consultant at NetSPI, a local cybersecurity consulting firm. I've been hacking since 2015 and have been credited in bug bounty programs for Snapchat, Netflix, Fastly, and more. Nowadays I spend my time hacking Fortune 500 companies, guiding development teams on how to secure their code, and creating open source security tools for those lovely Github stars.
