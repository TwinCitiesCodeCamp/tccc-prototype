Team Computer Glitz is a team of five girls (Four 9th graders and One 7th grader) who have competed in the Technovation MN program for the past 3 years.  We have also created mobile apps for their FIRST Lego League projects.  Ashley, Clare, Ellie, Nora, and Prapthi are passionate about STEM and coding.  We want to continue sharing our love for coding and STEM with others.   #mobileappsrock
