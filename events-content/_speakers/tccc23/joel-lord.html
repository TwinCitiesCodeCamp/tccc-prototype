Joel Lord is passionate about web and technology in general. He likes to learn new things, but most of all he likes to share his discoveries. He does so by travelling to various conferences all around the globe.

He graduated with a college degree in computer programming back in the last millennium. Apart for a little break to get his BSc in computational astrophysics, he has always been in the industry. As a technical evangelist with Auth0, he meets with developers to help them make the web a safer place.

During his free time, he is usually found stargazing in a campsite somewhere or brewing a fresh batch of beer in his garage.
