    Nicolaus Bauman is a former Hollywood director who turned away from Tinsel Town    after following up a blockbuster with a bomb so bad he was burned in effigy twice    in one week on his own lot. Now he code quietly in the corner in the much more virulently    realistic Midwest. He's never looked back. So he's have come to relish doling out    the brutal truth rather than the Hollywood version in code and in life.
