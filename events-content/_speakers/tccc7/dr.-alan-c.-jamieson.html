    Dr. Alan C. Jamieson is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at St. Mary's    College of Maryland (no, it's not a private school). A theoretician by training,    working in self-stabilizing algorithms and dynamic programming, he also directs    undergraduate research in robotics and game development. He is the current director    for the fledgling SMCM Robotics Laboratory and RiverStudio, an undergraduate student-run    game development studio. He received his PhD in Computer Science from Clemson University    and a B.S. in Computer Science from Tulane University. Dr. Jamieson is also a giant    gamer geek and fancies himself quite the amateur chef.
