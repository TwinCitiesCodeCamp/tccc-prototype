I have been a developer with ThoughtWorks for almost 25 years and have enjoyed solving technical problems and making people happy along the way. I also love to travel. So life as a consultant has been great, giving me many chances to enable solutions while living in places I never would have dreamed of living while growing up, including Brazil, France, and India, and Zambia.

In addition to coding on many projects I have had the opportunity to facilitate training both internal to ThoughtWorks and at client sites over the years thus being able to share my craft with others. Most recently this includes delivering application security training to consultants around the globe, including training other trainers to deliver the same material.
