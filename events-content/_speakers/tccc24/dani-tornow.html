Dani Tornow is a Lead Software Engineer at Sanford Health in Sioux Falls, SD, working on the Imagenetics team to bring genetic testing to Sanford's patients and beyond. She loves systems, software, databases, and just making things work. She's been using AWS for over 2 years now and loves to share her information with others. In a past life, she might have been a unicorn, but in this one, she loves software, board games, and bad jokes.
