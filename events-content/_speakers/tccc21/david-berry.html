I'm a Solutions Architect with over 20 years of experience in building software systems. I started out as a Java developer and then switched to .NET in 2003. I've also done significant work with SQL Server and Oracle. I'm a Pluralsight author and I have presented talks at That Conference, Iowa Code Camp, Twin Cities Code Camp, Fox Valley .NET Users Group and the Cedar Rapids .NET Users Group.

In addition to my Pluralsight coursework and speaking experience, I've done lots of work in helping to mentor others in how to design and build better software systems. I try to bring a pragmatic approach to everything I do, making sure the software I build is simple, understandable and balances responsibilities between different components of the system. When speaking or teaching, I emphasize real world scenarios encountered by developers every day and show how to solve them so you can be more effective at what you do.
