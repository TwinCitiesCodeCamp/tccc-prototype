I am a construction worker turned Technical Evangelist at Microsoft and based out of Philadelphia, PA. My biggest passion is in working with students and startups across the country, to help get their projects off the ground.

My work frequently has me building projects on game consoles, the web, and high performance mobile applications.

My role has me speaking in front of audiences of all ages and technical backgrounds on a weekly basis. From that experience, I've learned to put on dynamic and engaging presentations which keep the audience involved in a dialogue, instead of being lectured to.
