    After moving to Milwaukee from the Pacific Northwest, Mark joined Quad/Graphics    Inc. in 2002, where he currently works on the Development Infrastructure team. Recently    he has been getting his hands dirty with C#, iBatis, TDD, Mocks, and Continuous    Integration as he helps build a new enterprise platform for future software development.    Mark was introduced to iBatis about a year ago, and soon became interested in leveraging    its capabilities. Since then, he has been an ardent supporter and plans to contribute    to the iBatis project in the near future.
