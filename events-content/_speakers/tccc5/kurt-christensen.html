    Kurt Christensen is a complete idiot, and always has been, although Kurt's idiocy    wasn't unleashed onto the software community until 1995. Kurt has been weaseling    his way into interesting coding gigs ever since, always underqualified for the task    at hand. For the past four years, Kurt has also subtracted value from organizations    as an "agile" snake oil salesman. Kurt still tries to code as often as possible,    but the agile stuff pays more per hour, so of course you can see the difficulty.
