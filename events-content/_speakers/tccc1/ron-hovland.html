    As the senior developer instructor at New Horizons of Minnesota, Ron Hovland is    the go-to person for our staff as well as other instructors. In essence, he teaches    the teachers. And, if he doesn't know the answer, he always knows exactly where    to find it. Ron's BA and graduate work in education, as well as extensive experience    with development work, make him an excellent resource for our staff and for our    students. Ron also develops custom courseware for us and helps clients and colleagues    troubleshoot a variety of software applications. In 2005, he obtained his ITIL Managers    certification and now teaches ITIL courses.<h3>    Links</h3><ul>    <li><a href="http://www.newhorizonsmn.com ">New Horizons of Minnesota</a></li></ul>
