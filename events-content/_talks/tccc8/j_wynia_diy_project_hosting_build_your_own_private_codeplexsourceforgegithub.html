<p>    When you start a software project and want to collaborate with others, setting up    the tools can be a project unto itself. If the needs of your project happen to match    up exactly with the rules and restrictions of existing open source project hosting    options: Codeplex, Sourceforge, Github, Google Code, etc., those can be a great    choice. However, setting up all of those services, on your own domain, is easier    than you think and can be done on $9/month web hosting while giving you complete    control with few restrictions. In this session, we'll set up git/svn, bug tracking,    project management, blogging, wiki, mailing lists and Jabber instant messenger for    a project on Dreamhost.</p>
