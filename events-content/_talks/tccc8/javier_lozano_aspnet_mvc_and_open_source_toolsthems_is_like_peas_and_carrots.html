<p>    The flexibility ASP.NET MVC framework makes it very easy for web developers to swap    components (in-house, 3rd party or open source) in and out from their applications.    In this session we will assemble different open source tools such as NHibernate,    MvcContrib, MVC Turbine and Windsor Container to create a simple blog engine with    minimal effort.</p><p>    If you're currently using any of these open source tools within your Web Form applications    or you're wondering how fully leverage the separation of concerns MVC offers, then    you should definitely check out this session.</p>
