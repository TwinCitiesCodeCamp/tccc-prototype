<p>    In this session, Donn will delve into the basic requirements for you to get started    with Android development. We will cover the architecture of the Android operating    system as well as some ins-and-outs of Android mobile development. Starting with    the basic install (Eclipse and Android SDK) an actual Android Application will be    created during this session that will be published to the Android Marketplace in    real time. A general understanding of the Java language is advised but not required.</p>
