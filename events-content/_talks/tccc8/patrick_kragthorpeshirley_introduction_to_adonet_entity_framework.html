<p>    ADO.NET 3.5's Entity Framework presents us with several new options for accessing    data within our application. EF can be used build applications against a conceptual    model that is mapped to the logic data model. The goal of this session is to provide    an overview of the components provided within the ADO.NET Entity Framework including    EntityClient, Entity SQL, Object Services, the Entity Data Model, and LINQ to Entities.    This session will explore these and other features and will provide several examples    of how to properly apply this technology to your own development project.</p>
