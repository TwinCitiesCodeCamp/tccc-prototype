<p>    Dynamic .NET is going mainstream with the upcoming promotion of the Dynamic Language    Runtime into .NET 4. This session will discuss what the DLR is, how it works with    C# 4 and Visual Basic 10, and why this doesn't mean C# has jumped the shark. We    will also look at some ways in which these features can be used to solve real-world    problems.</p>
