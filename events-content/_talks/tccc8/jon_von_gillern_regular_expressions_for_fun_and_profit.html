<p>    The Regular Expression is one of the most powerful, yet least understood features    of any programing language. In this session, we'll cover:</p><ul>    <li>The basic internals of the Regex engine</li>    <li>Regex Gotchas, Tips and Tricks</li>    <li>How to format your regexes to be much more programmer friendly</li>    <li>Input data validation</li>    <li>When to use code instead of regexes</li>    <li>Regular expression tools</li>    <li>How to save boat loads of time with complex text manipulation</li></ul><p>    While the some of the demos will use Visual Studio, the session is intended for    developers of all languages that support Regular Expressions, regardless of their    familiarity with the subject.</p>
