<p>    "Getting Things Done" (the personal productivity framework) helps busy professionals    manage their work and goals with a set of personal tools and techniques. Scrum (the    agile software development framework) helps organizations manage the process of    software development with a set of organizational tools and techniques. We'll spend    time introducing and discussing both, and then explore the principles of productivity    they have in common.</p>
