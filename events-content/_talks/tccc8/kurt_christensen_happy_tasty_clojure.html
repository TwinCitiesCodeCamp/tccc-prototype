<p>    Clojure is a dialect of Lisp which runs on the Java Virtual Machine and is designed    for easy integration with existing Java code, and also provides features like software    transactional memory, lazily-evaluated sequences, and more. In this presentation,    I will provide a brief introduction to what Clojure is, and how it can be used.</p>
