<p>    Need to implement Continuous Integration but can't afford Team Foundation Server?    Hudson is an open-source CI platform that is easy to use and is has a management-friendly    interface. This session will walk through the capabilities of Hudson CI with the    NAnt build scripting engine and demo a basic build that performs the build, unit    tests, code complexity tests, and comment notes.</p>
