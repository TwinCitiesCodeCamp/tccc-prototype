<p>    As enterprise software development has evolved we have identified patterns and practices    that help us write more extensible and maintainable applications. Patterns with    the names of Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control have emerged to simplify    the reuse of existing components and aide us in wiring together disparate components.    Frameworks have been built to support these patterns. This presentation will explain    the patterns and enable you to build your own custom framework or review existing    frameworks to meet your needs.</p>
