<p>    Take a look at how you can get started developing applications for Windows Phone    7 Series using the free downloadable tools that are now available. Starting off    with an overview of the Windows Phone platform, we'll then cover the new application    model, updated control templates, themes, and services available to Windows Phone    applications. We will also cover new input paradigms including multi-touch, software    keyboard, accelerometer and microphone, as well as the APIs to leverage phone applications    like email, phone dialer, contact list and more.</p>
