<p>    Windows PowerShell ( formerly code-named Monad) is a fantastic addition to any developer    or power user's set of tools. Windows Power shell has the widest range of any language    known. Quickly learn the basic concepts, it's a command line shell to write simple    adhoc scripts. Learn a bit more and use it to write rich sophisticated scripts to    manage production servers and the like. Taken even further, use it to write .Net    programs with the full power of the .Net frameworks.</p>
