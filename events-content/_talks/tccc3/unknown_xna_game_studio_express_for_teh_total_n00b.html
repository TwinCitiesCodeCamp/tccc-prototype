<p>    In this session, we'll start from Ground Zero and hit all the high points of Game    Development with XNA. We'll spend a few minutes on what you need to get everything    running along with where to find it. Then we'll talk about what XNA (&amp; XNA GSE)    is and is not! We'll cover Creator's Club, the 360 and finally we'll jump into some    code, talk about the game loop and dissect a working game. We'll also give away    an XNA book or two.</p>
