<p>    This session will take a look at building REST-style services using WCF 3.0 and    3.5. It will provide a brief introduction to REST and what its advantages over typical    WS-* services are, especially for browser-based applications. The majority of the    session will be spent showing what it takes to build REST services using WCF 3.0    and how things get even better and easier with WCF 3.5.</p>
