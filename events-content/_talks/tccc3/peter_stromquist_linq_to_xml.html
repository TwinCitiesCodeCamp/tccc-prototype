<p>    We've been hearing a lot about LINQ lately, the new data access technology in the    upcoming 3.5 version of .NET. We've heard how it can be used to easily access data    from a variety of sources like custom objects, SQL Server, web services, and XML.    This session focuses on how to use LINQ to quickly and intuitively query XML data.    We'll take a look at the new XML object model in the System.Xml.Linq namespace (XDocument,    XElement, etc.) and how it supports LINQ to XML. While most of our time will be    spent in C#, we will also examine the new "XML literals" language feature in VB.NET    and how it makes coding LINQ to XML even easier.</p>
