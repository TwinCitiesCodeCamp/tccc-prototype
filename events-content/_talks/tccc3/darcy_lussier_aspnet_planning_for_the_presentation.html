<p>    <i>        "[Javascript/Client Side Code] must be viewed as being a separate application that        interacts with your application as it runs on the server." – Rocky Lhotka, Expert        C# 2005 Business Objects.    </i> The presentation layer of web applications has    evolved into a complex tier that can be sometimes overlooked and underestimated.    In this session we'll discuss best practices for implementing rich client interfaces,    de-mystify what ‘AJAX' really is, and explore the process of architecting a Presentation    layer.</p>
