<p>    NBusiness is an open source code generation project aimed specifically at the business    logic layer and the data access layer. NBusiness includes an Entity Language Provider,    E# compiler and a light weight business object framework. This discussion will describe    how to create an Entity Library with NBusiness, generate a database and integrate    it into an ASP.NET website. In addition we will discuss some methods in which you    can extend NBusiness and your generated business objects with custom code. NBusiness    leverages visual studio extensibility quite heavily, and this will also be a topic    of discussion.</p>
