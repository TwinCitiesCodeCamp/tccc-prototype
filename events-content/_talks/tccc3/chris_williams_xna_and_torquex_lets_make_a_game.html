<p>    This session assumes a basic familiarity with XNA. We'll take a look at what TorqueX    (Garage Games) has to offer XNA game developers and we'll go through a quick game    (using one of the TorqueX starter kits.) Time permitting, we'll also talk about    some of the resource packs from Garage Games.</p>
