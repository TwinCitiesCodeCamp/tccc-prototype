<p>    Quixo is a simple board game that is very similar to tic-tac-toe with a little more    complexity. In this session, we'll take the game from the 2D world into 3D space.    We'll discuss the underlying engine, the add-in model, design tools, and the client    application that renders the game using WPF.</p>
