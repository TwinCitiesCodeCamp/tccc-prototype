<p>    There are two primary ways of doing code generation: one, using code generation    mechanisms such as "wizards" that someone else provides and, two, creating your    own code generation templates. Writing your own code generation templates is coding,    pure and simple (well perhaps not so simple). I am going to show you how to code    templates using XML/XSLT, CodeSmith, MyGeneration, and (maybe) Orcas Software Factories.    This will include a lot of code from templates that I have written (will write)    for generating CSLA applications. One of the problems in generating code is how    to extend the generated functionality. No matter how cleverly you code the code    generation templates, there will always be some functionality that makes more sense    to generate by hand. I will take a look at three different approaches to how to    add that functionality to the generated code: using partial classes, using inheritance,    and using delegates. Unit testing is one very important factor in wanting to extend    to extend the generated code. I will cover some ways to structure the code, generated    and hand-crafted, to support unit testing.</p>
