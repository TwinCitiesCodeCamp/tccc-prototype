<p>    Software testing has gained a lot of interest in the recent past. Similarly, determining    system capabilities has been something people increasingly care about. But how do    you truly know what your system's capabilities are? How do you know for instance,    that the result of a stress test are not just a fluke or isolated incident? How    can you make accurate and responsible predictions about scalability? A few mathematical    techniques collectively known as Statistical Process control can provide an excellent    mechanism for measuring system performance and resource usage. It provides a solid    theoretical framework so there's no more "Seems to me like it should do ______"    or "Well, to me it looks right..." Statistical Process control was the driving force    behind Toyota, Nissan and Honda's successes, as well as Sony, Nakamichi and many    other brands known for their quality. And it can be applied to virtually every aspect    of software. To use it, you need a pencil, piece of paper and a calculator, although    a copy of Excel makes it really simple. No expensive tools needed and no heavy learnign    curve.</p>
