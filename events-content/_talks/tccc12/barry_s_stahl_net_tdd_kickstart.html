<p>    In this session, the speaker and the audience will "pair up" for a coding session    which will serve as an introduction to Test Driven Development in an Agile environment.    We will use C#, Visual Studio and Rhino Mocks to unit test code to be built both    with and without dependencies. We will also highlight some of the common issues    encountered during TDD and discuss strategies for overcoming them.</p>
