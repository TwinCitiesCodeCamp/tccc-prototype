<p>    NuGet is a relatively new package management tool for the .Net framework. While    many of us have used it, not many of us have really looked too deeply into it. In    this talk, we'll learn what NuGet is, how to use it, how to get the most out of    it, how to build your own NuGet package and host it on your own NuGet feed.</p>
