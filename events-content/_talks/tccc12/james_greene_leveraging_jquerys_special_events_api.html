<p>    The jQuery JavaScript library has become a household item in the web development    community. It allows for simple event binding, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous    requests. Many developers know they can extend jQuery using their simple plugin    development process ... but did you also know that jQuery is extensible in other    ways as well? We will focus on extending jQuery's event system via the Special Events    API in order to create our own custom bindable events, such as "multiclick", "textSelect",    and "swipe".</p>
