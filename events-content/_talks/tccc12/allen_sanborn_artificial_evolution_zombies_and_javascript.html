<p>    Learn a bit about how to use artificial life algorithms and evolutionary algorithms    to survive the coming zombie apocalypse. Evolutionary algorithms are inspired by    some mechanisms from biologicial evolution (reproduction, mutation, recombination    and selection) but aren't hindered by silly little things like how real biological    systems actually work. We can harness these ideas to solve problems and optimize    strategies that can help us get through our day to day activities or help us avoid    having our brains eaten. The presentation will range from fundamental ideas to functional    demos done in JavaScript (or CoffeeScript).</p>
