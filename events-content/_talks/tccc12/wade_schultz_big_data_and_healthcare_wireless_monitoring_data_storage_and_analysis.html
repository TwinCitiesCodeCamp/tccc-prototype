<p>    In this session we will cover several topics related to obtaining, storing, and    analyzing health and fitness data. With the increasing number of cheap, portable    monitoring devices, individuals can capture and record health-related data almost    constantly. Unfortunately, few of these devices are capable of integrating or providing    a useful assessment of the measurements. We will demonstrate how to quickly capture    data from Bluetooth-enabled devices such as the Wii Balance Board, Zephyr Bioharness,    and others using both WPF and Android applications. Once the data is captured, we    will store these real-time results in MongoDB and provide a simple web service secured    with Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) to access and submit data securely from mobile    devices. Providing efficient, integrated services such as these will be increasingly    important in providing the best data and analysis possible to both healthcare providers    and consumers.</p>
