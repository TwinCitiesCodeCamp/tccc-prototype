<p>    With the public release of Project Roslyn, Microsoft has finally let .NET developers    get access to their long-awaited compiler APIs. The potential impact of having a    compiler API available for all developers is immense. In this session, you'll get    a tour of the elements behind this new API, such as syntax trees and engines, and    how you can use them in code analysis and metaprogramming techniques.</p>
