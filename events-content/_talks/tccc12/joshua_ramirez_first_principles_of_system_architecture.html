<p>    If part of your job is designing architecture for a system then I'm sure you'll    find this talk interesting. Many of us find ourselves struggling to keep up with    the complexity of the evolving systems we support. Have you applied best practices    but still feel like you could have better - a lot better? I have. Come find out    what I've been learning about how to achieve some harmony in the design of an enterprise    system. Find out how the lessons of OOP, SOA, EDA, DDD, CQRS, and other buzzwords    can be distilled into a core set of first principles. Using these ideas I hope to    share how to begin thinking about architecture instead of learning how to copy architecture.    I'll be demonstrating this thinking in practice by walking you through the design    of an online ordering system, and I'll leave you with the resources you need to    continue your journey.</p>
