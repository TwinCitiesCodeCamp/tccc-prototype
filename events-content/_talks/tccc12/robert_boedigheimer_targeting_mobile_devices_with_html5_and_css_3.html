<p>    Mobile devices adoption rates have been amazing, including smartphone sales passing    sales for PCs. Does your web site work well on mobile devices? Do you want to leverage    your web development skills to provide mobile solutions to a broad range of devices    rather than learn how to develop in multiple languages for multiple device platforms?    Learn how HTML5 and CSS 3 are dramatically changing the capabilities of web sites    on mobile devices, and how you can adapt your web site to be not just available    but efficient across a broad array of devices.</p>
