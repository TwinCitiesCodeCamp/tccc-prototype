<p>    GMail, Twitter, Turntable; Rich client-side applications are hot! Plus there are    great advantages to it: highly responsive to the user, minimized network traffic,    and consolidated rendering logic.</p><p>    But Javascript tends to decay faster than strongly typed languages. This makes it    even more important to structure your code in a modular, testable, and maintainable    way. Modern Javascript libraries like these make structuring your application easier    than ever!</p><ul>    <li>Backbone.js -- Model-View-Template structure </li>    <li>Underscore.js -- General Purpose Javascript Utility</li>    <li>Require.js -- Dependency Management</li></ul><p>    Together, we will build a Javascript web application atop these libraries--exploring    client-side rendering, managing user state, consuming data, and error handleing.</p>
