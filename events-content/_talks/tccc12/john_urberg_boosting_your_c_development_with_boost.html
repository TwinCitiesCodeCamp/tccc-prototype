<p>    There has been a resurgence if interest in C++. Boost is a set of open source C++    libraries that are designed to work well with the C++ Standard Library. The libraries    are peer reviewed and many of the libraries are implementations of upcoming C++    standard library releases. The libraries are cross platform and work on most modern    operating systems. The presentation will cover some common libraries that you may    want to use to simplify and speed up your C++ development.</p>
