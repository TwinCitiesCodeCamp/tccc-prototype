<p>    We all know that technology moves fast, particularly web technologies. It can be    overwhelming trying to keep up with it all. In this session I will show some techniques    for drinking from the information fire hose, and quickly discuss some late-breaking    technologies that web developers should be investing some time to learn, including    MVC, KnockoutJS, BackboneJS, Jasmine, CoffeeScript, Bootstrap, KendoUI and more!</p>
