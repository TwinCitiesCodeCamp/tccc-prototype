<p>    The real world problems we're asked to solve with software are messy, the business    rules change constantly, and they vary by customer or by context. Moving the things    that change regularly into plugins lets you keep your core product solid while maintaining    the flexibility your applications need. We'll use MEF (Managed Extensibility Framework)    provide that functionality to a simple C# application.</p>
