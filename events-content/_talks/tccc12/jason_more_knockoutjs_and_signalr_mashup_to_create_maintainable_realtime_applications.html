<p>    Combining two powerful web technoglies - KnockoutJS (MVVM for the web) and SignalR    (Async signaling for real-time, multi-user web applications), you can create a web    application that lets users communicate in real time with minimal development. We'll    quickly explore simple setup for both, then show how nicely they compliment each    other. We'll finish with an audience driven game of "Family Feud" built on this    technology stack.</p>
