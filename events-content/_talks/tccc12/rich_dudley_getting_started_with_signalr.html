<p>    SignalR is an asynchronous signaling library for ASP.NET. It's designed to help    you build real-time web applications without a lot of hassle. In the past, developers    would have to wire up "real-time" applications as a series of polls to a webserver,    waiting for it to receive data back that was useful. This approach usually cost    more in bandwidth than we wanted it to. SignalR simplifies this process, and makes    it more useful for the ASP.NET developer. In this presentation, Kevin Griffin will    guide you through implementing SignalR into your applications, and how you can take    advantage of everything it has to offer.</p>
