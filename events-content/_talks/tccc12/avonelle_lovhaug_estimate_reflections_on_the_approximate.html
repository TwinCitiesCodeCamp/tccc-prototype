<p>    "When will it be done?" is the question most dreaded by software developers. You    may think the most important tools for creating software estimates are a crystal    ball and a divining rod, but there is a better way that won't involve magic. Plus,    accurate software development estimates can enhance your professional image in your    organization, and make life better by eliminating the mad dash at the end of the    project. This session will improve your estimating accuracy by teaching you several    techniques that I've learned through my 16+ years as a software consultant. It will    also show you how to handle situations where an accurate estimate isn't possible.    Bring your estimating questions and war stories!</p>
