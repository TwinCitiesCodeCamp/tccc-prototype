<p>    Embracing HTTP is an important property of well constructed ReSTful and web apis.    Every web developer is familiar with GET and POST, 200 and 404, Accept and Content-Type;    but what about 207 and 413, OPTIONS and PROPFIND, Transfer-Encoding and X-File-Size?    This session will be based on usage of various HTTP methods, headers and status    codes drawn from the development of large scale, web applications. Examples will    include raw HTTP, mixed in with JavaScript and ASP.NET MVC code.</p>
