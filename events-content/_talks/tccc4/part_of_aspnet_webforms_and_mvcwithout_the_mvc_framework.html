<p>    You don't need the ASP.NET MVC Framework to implement MVC with the current Web Form    implementation of ASP.Net. In this session we'll talk about how to architect a web    application using the MVC pattern, but not the MVC framework, and discuss what the    differences/tradeoffs are between the two.</p>
