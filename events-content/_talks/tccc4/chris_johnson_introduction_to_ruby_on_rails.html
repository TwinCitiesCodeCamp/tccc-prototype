<p>    Have you ever wondered what Ruby and Rails was all about, and why Microsoft has    started to lure some of leading RoR experts to work for them in Redmond? Ruby on    Rails is a full-scale framework for developing web applications. During this talk    we'll explore the Rails framework, how it encourages test driven development, and    team collaboration. As we explore the framework we'll actually build a working application    from scratch.</p><p>    <a href="http://www.johnsonch.com/resources/Code_Camp_Spring_2008.zip  ">Presentation Material</a></p>
