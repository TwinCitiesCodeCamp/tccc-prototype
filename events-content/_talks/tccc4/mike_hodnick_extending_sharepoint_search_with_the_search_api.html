<p>    Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007 provides a very powerful search engine,    but the out-of-the-box search features can only take your apps built in MOSS so    far. In addition, you can't use the out-of-the-box capabilities in an application    that doesn't run in the context of MOSS. This presentation will walk through the    MOSS search API (including the search web service) and demonstrate how to execute    MOSS searches programmatically. We'll touch on executing Full Text and Keyword searches,    as well as writing better code to wrap all types of calls and searches into a reusable    set of classes.</p><p>    <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/archive/2008/04/06/twin-cities-code-camp---sharepoint-search-api-slides-and.aspx">Presentation Material</a></p>
