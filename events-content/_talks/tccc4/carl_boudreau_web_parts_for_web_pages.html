<p>    Web Parts for Web Pages will demonstrate how easy it is to build a personalized    and customizable web page for your Users with that iGoogle or Yahoo functionality    we all love to use. Time will be short so we will start with a partially built web    application that uses a master page, menu control, and the new user authentication    controls. Then I will demonstrate how to add User Controls that your user can add    or remove from their home page.</p>
