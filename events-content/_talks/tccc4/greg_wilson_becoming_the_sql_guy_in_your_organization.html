<p>    As we learned our first programming languages, most developers learned a little    bit about SQL. But, for many, their understanding of SQL never grew much beyond    the basic CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations, some joins and occasionally    the basics of using a cursor. Are you tired of taking all your SQL problems to other    developers, begging for help? Want to become â€˜The SQL Guy' that everybody else brings    their questions to? Join me for a rapid fire session that will help transform you    from SQL White-belt to SQL Black belt. We will hit things like query optimization,    recursion, tips on data-access layers in your apps and much more. Designed for the    average developer who wants to step-up their SQL skills.</p>
