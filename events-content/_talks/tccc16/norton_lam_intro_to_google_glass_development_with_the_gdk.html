<p>    A lot of media attention has been given to Google Glass.  Some believe it is the future, others think it is just a passing fad.  Like the iPhone before it, it's success will depend a lot on the applications that will be developed for it.</p><p>    Google is selling Glass to those interested in trying out the technology, called Glass Explorers.  Many of them are beginning to create very interesting applications for the device.</p><p>    This talk will introduce you to Glass and the basics of Glass development with the Glass Development Kit.  Topics will include hardware and software capabilities and show code that accesses them.  The Mirror API will be touched on, but not covered.</p>
