<p>    You have mountains of data. Users demand instant rich interactions.  Businesses need deeper insights from that data. How can you group, search, and drill down into big data in real-time without crushing the database or writing cumbersome map/reduce jobs?</p><p>    Elastic Search is the distributed, open source answer to your problems. It’s a powerful tool that slices and dices massive data sets in real-time. In this talk we’ll see some live demos that showcase the power of Elastic Search, but would melt a traditional database. Things like full text searching, nested groupings, and real-time analytics. We’ll also discuss when and why you would use Elastic Search over more conventional alternatives.</p>
