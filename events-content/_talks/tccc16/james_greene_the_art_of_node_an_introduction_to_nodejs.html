<p>    By now, most developers have heard of Node.js — the dominant "server-side JavaScript engine" — but many still haven't worked with it.  Come listen, learn, and play along as we explore the world of Node.</p><p>    Attendees can expect answers to the following questions:</p><ul>    <li>What is Node, really?</li>    <li>What is Node good for? What is Node exceptionally great for?</li>    <li>Why should I care about Node? Isn't it only used by "hipster" startups? I work in the enterprise!</li>    <li>How do I use Node?</li>    <li>How should I structure my Node application?</li>    <li>What is NPM? How do I use it?</li>    <li>Is there an analogous Node module to my beloved "Library XYZ" for .NET (or other languages/runtimes)?</li>    <li>Can I only use Node on the server-side?</li>    <li>...and so much more!</li></ul><p>    Attendees should have basic familiarity with the JavaScript language and how to use a command line (terminal).</p>
