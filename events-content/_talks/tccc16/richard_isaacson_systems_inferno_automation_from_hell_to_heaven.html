<p>    A conversation of the Systems journey from Operator to Architect. We will cover techniques and tools that apply to each of the job title stages. In addition we will talk about how systems automation isnâ€™t confined and is becoming relevant to the application development life-cycle. While this talk is very Unix family focused the general topics should apply to any operating system. Management is welcome to attend as the talk may give them an idea of what their teams should be doing and how to support their team.</p><p>    We will not be dwelling long on on any one technology stack as we will favor a strong overview of what the journey should look like. Executing commands from notes, from memory, in scripts, as a part of tools, and via push button self-service will be our major mile markers.</p>
