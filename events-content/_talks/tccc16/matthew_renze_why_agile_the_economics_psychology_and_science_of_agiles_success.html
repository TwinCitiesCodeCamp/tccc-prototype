<p>    Most presentations on Agile practices only cover what Agile is and how Agile practices work. However, in this session, you will learn why Agile practices like Scrum, TDD, and refactoring are so effective in terms of economics, psychology, and science. In addition, we'll explain the success of Agile practices with insights from various scientific fields including Information Theory, Network Theory, and Game Theory. Whether you're still unsold on the value of Agile, actively practicing Agile, or need to convince others of the value of Agile, this presentation is for you.</p>
