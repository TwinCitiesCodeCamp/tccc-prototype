<p>    Create your own HTML tags with Custom Elements!</p><p>    Take your hands off the handlebars.js with HTML Templates!</p><p>    Seamlessly reuse front-end code with HTML Imports!</p><p>    Shine light on the Shadow DOM!</p><p>    In this session, you'll learn how the brand new "Web Components" standards will help you "define widgets with a level of visual richness and interactivity not possible with CSS alone, and ease of composition and reuse not possible with script libraries today." In other words, you can finally encapsulate and extend HTML itself, and it's awesome.</p><p>    Plus, we'll make a brand new &lt;custom-blink&gt; tag in the first five minutes. The Web will thank us later.</p>
