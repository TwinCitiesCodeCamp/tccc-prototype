<p>    The latest version of HTML is not completely standardized yet, but there are parts that are available in the latest version of browsers.  There are many new elements, including those that provide more semantic meaning to common &lt;div&gt; elements (like header, footer, etc).  A new &lt;canvas&gt; can be used for drawing, while the &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; provide new multimedia capabilities.  New input types are utilized by devices to provide context sensitive keyboards and improved usability.  The new application caching and web storage provide the capability for disconnected web sites for smartphones and tablets.  Learn about support for HTML 5 in major browsers, and see how Modernizr can provide feature detection and smooth fallbacks via various polyfills.</p>
