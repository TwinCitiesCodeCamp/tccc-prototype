<p>    What is Live Coding? Live Coding is an emerging art form in which performers use programming languages to create live, improvised sound and visuals. Rebuffing trends in turn-key computer DJ software, Live Coding embraces transparency, improvisation, and a raw, genuine, hands-on approach to electronic musical performance. In this session we will explore Live Coding and its impact on the arts, education, and software engineering. We will dig in to some popular Live Coding environments that YOU can use today to create with. Last, but certainly not least, we will make beautiful noise with code and a pair of speakers.</p>
