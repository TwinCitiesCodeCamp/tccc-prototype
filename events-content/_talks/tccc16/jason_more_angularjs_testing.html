<p>    The first time you you write tests for any new framework can be challenging. How do you setup the tests? How do you run them efficiently? What about mocking upstream callers? Is any of it really worth it?</p><p>    During this talk I’ll show you how to write unit tests for Angular controllers, directives, services, along with browser components such as setTimeout and making HTTP calls. I’ll be writing my tests in Jasmine, and continuously running them in Karma. Then we will wrap up by writing one end-to-end test using Protractor.</p>
