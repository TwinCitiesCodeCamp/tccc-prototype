<p>    I've given a few talks about Haskell at previous TCCCs, but one thing that kept coming up was that people would say "hey, I want to do some hands-on stuff."</p><p>    Well you're in luck. I'm going to go through a quick hands-on intro to Haskell. Bring your computer and get ready to hack. I'll teach the basics of programming with Haskell. You'll learn the data structures, functions, and other tidbits necessary to start really writing code. Come see for yourself what everyone's been talking about!</p><p>    I'll assume only a basic level of computer programming. If you're comfortable in another language like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, or Java you'll be fine. Even if you aren't quite comfortable, you should still be able to follow along and maybe you'll even be at an advantage, not having to ignore all you know about imperative programming!</p>
