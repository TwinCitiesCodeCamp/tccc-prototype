Building mobile applications for multiple applications can be a handful - different IDEs, languages, and platform APIs. With Xamarin, all of that is converged with Microsoft's .NET framework and Xamarin, an open source C# solution for writing cross platform mobile applications which export native code. 
This session will give you the information you need to understand Xamarin.Forms, which allows you to re-use one code base for both your front and back-end code.  You will live demos illustrating how easy it is to simultaneously create your app for iOS, Android, and the Universal Windows Platform.
