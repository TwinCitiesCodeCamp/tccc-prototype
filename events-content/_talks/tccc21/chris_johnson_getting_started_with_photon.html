This Internet of Things seems to be the rage these days, come see what the "cool" kids are hacking on these days.  In this talk we'll look at some of the hardware, code used to control these devices and if the internet is working some examples.  I'll also talk about my experience hacking together little projects using the photon and Raspberry PI.
