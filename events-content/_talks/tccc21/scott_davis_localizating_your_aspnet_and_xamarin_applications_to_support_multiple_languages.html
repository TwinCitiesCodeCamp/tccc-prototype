QONQR (pronounced Conquer) is a mobile game built using Xamarin and ASP.net web platform. This 2 developer company supports applications on Windows Phone, Android and iPhone with a complex Azure cloud platform. QONQR is now available in 7 languages, with translations crowdsourced from the players. In this talk we'll discuss the challenges of supporting an application in multiple languages, UI design, translator coordination, and the unexpected technical challenges.  Out of the box solutions available in .Net can cause significant negative side effects. We'll discuss how to avoid them and will demo how to integrate the Microsoft Multilingual App Toolkit into your cross platform solution.
