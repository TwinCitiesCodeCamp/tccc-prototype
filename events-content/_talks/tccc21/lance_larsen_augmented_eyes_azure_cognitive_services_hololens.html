The Information Age has Evolved, Welcome to the Age of Experiences!

We are living through another critical stage in the evolution of technology. 

We - and especially those that follow us - will no longer be satisfied with looking at flat computer screens either at our desks, or even on our mobile devices.  

We will come to demand to be immersed within a data enhanced visual environment. 

With but a single glance, we are at the very beginning of looking at our world through Augmented Eyes. 


Azure's Cognitive Services provides a number of powerful but easy to use services for Facial Recognition, Emotional Recognition, and Visual Analysis.

Now - unite that with the Augmented Reality of Hololensâ€¦ and we are living Sci-Fi today.

Join Microsoft MVP, Lance Larsen for this code-heavy talk with many examples of how you can start utilizing Cognitive Services today, and how you can shape the visual future with the Hololens!
