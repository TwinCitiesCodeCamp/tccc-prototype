Programmer's rejoice! Don't settle by filling your games with hastily drawn MS Paint scribbles. Learn how to quickly, easily, and cheaply build voxel art, a blocky 3D art style popularized in games such as Minecraft and Crossy Road. We'll look at the basic building blocks (pun intended) of creating models in Qubicle (http://qubicle-constructor.com) a 3D voxel art editor. Then we'll apply basic animation techniques using the freely available Blender (https://www.blender.org/) software package and finish it up by getting that art up and running in a scene within Unity (http://unity3d.com/).
