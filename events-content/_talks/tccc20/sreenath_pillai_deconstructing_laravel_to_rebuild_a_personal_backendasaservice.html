Laravel is a popular PHP MVC framework, using the common design pattern to separate concerns, improve performance, and organize code. We will break down and understand the base components of the framework, and then rebuild it in a way that is as framework-agnostic as possible. Then we will add some features to turn it into a 'Backend-as-a-Service' that you can use to speed up the development of your web, mobile, or IoT projects! Lastly, we will build classes in both JS and Objective-C to demonstrate how to talk with our newly created backend.
