We've all heard of Bitcoin by now, but what's the next step in blockchain technology? How about a distributed, decentralized turing complete computer in the cloud? That's the premise behind Ethereum, a new blockchain that takes the technology pioneered by Bitcoin to the next level. In this session I'll give an overview of what Ethereum can do, and then walk you through a simple hello world Ethereum application in both the Mix IDE and the geth command line client.
