Come explore Elm, a functional programming language for making web things. Elm aims to solve some of the same problems that Ember, React, and Angular 2 solve, but in a radically different way. Strong and static typing ensures that data you pass around in your apps really is what you think it is. A simple and tried-and-true architecture makes it easy to understand, and great tooling makes it fun to use.<br><br>In this talk, we'll explore how we use Elm to build our user interface and our code, and we'll take an honest look at where Elm can make a difference for you, and where it falls short. By the end of the talk, you'll know how to get started and have all the resources you need to explore Elm on your own.
