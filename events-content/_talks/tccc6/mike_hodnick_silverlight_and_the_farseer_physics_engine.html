<p>    <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/archive/2009/04/04/twin-cities-code-camp-silverlightfarseer-physics-materials.aspx" target="_blank">Presentation Materials</a></p><p>    In this code and demo-heavy session, you will learn how to use the Farseer Physics    engine with Silverlight to create dynamic and unique scenes in a browser. We'll    wire up the Farseer engine to the UI, handle collisions, join physics bodies together,    and control parameters such as gravity and friction. Presenting data and offering    a user interface with physics-like qualities is becoming commonplace in cutting    edge applications, and the Farseer engine with Silverlight is one way to deliver    that experience.</p>
