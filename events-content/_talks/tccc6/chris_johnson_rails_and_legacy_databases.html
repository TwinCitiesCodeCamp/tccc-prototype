<p>    Have you been to Ruby on Rails talks and found the framework interesting? Do you    want to use Ruby on Rails for your next project but have to connect to a legacy    database and don't know if Rails will work? Rails' object relational mapping allows    to connect to legacy databases easily and use rails conventions to build your web    application, without disrupting the database. During this talk we will look at a    very hideous database (something that I hope no one will ever see) and build a simple    rails application on top of it. This demo will revolve around using SQL Server 2005.</p>
