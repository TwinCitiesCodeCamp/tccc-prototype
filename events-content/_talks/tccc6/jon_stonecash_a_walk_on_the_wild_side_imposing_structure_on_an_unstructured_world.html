<p>    <a href="http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/archive/2009/04/19/Spring-2009-Code-Camp-Software-Solution.aspx" target="_blank">Presentation Materials</a></p><p>    One definition of programming is the extraction of formal structure from unstructured    situations. The "real world" is chaotic. When we develop software, we abstract from    this messy maelstrom to build database tables and software objects that are, at    least relatively, more structured. But it is impossible to eliminate the mess. Anyone    who writes that part of the application that accepts data at the "edge" of the application    knows just how messy it can be. There are three ways that the application design    can respond to the data entry problem:</p><ul>    <li>        Reduce the complexity of the data entry by requiring the user to parse the data        into individual textboxes that are so simple as to be un-interesting. If you build        applications this way, turn your head away in shame. Stand tall and say, "I will        not make my users do work that the computer software can and should be doing."    </li>    <li>        Build logic to parse the mess and extract as much of the meaning from the maelstrom.        This is fun, interesting, and useful. There are several ways of doing this and each        way leads to lots of opportunities to show you some code.    </li>    <li>        Add structure under the covers by using "micro formats". Again, this is a good        thing that lends itself to more opportunities to show you some code.    </li></ul><p>    Just so you won't think parsing and micro formats are only for the "fancy folk",    we will look at parsing and micro formats to deal with common data entry items such    as addresses and phone numbers. These "ordinary data entry problems" can be very    difficult to solve in the general case. We will parse these items with regular expressions,    programmatic state machines, and formal parsers, noting the wonders and woes of    each approach. Once you have struggled with handing the entry of these items, you    should be motivated to make it easier for others by tagging your output using "micro    formats" that vastly reduce the effort for other programs to accept the output your    applications produce.</p>
