But what about when we need to start building    full object graphs into our test in order to test an interaction or state? Yeah,    Houston, we have a problem. With mocks we can streamline development by mocking    out dependencies. Mocks will allow us to not only mock our dependencies but to also    test our interactions and state very easily. In this session learn how to use mocks    in your day to day testing.</p>
