<p>    <a href="http://tinyurl.com/c7r4s3" target="_blank">Presentation Materials</a></p><p>    In layered applications, the presentation layer is just as important as navigation    logic, business logic, and data access. While you should try to keep the presentation    layer independent from the UI technology and platform in order to improve testability,    it's not always easy to do. Design patterns can help. In this session I'll discuss    design patterns such as Model View Controller (MVC) and Model View Presenter (MVP)    for building presentation layers that can truly be used across multiple platforms,    including WPF, Silverlight and Windows Mobile, and in Software as a Service (SaaS)    scenarios.</p>
