<p>    With multi-core computers becoming commonplace, and technologies like Silverlight    requiring the use of asynchronous programming, and the use of distributed service-based    computing spreading, we are entering an era where parallel and concurrent programming    is virtually required. Are you ready to be multi-threaded? Parallel? Concurrent?    Are you ready to build applications that are not only parallel, but distributed?    This session will discuss the drivers of this change, the challenges we face, and    some of the solutions available today and in the near future on the Microsoft .NET    platform.</p>
