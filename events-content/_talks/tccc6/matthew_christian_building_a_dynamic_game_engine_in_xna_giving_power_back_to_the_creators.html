<p>    In this talk, different methods for implementing a dynamic game engine are introduced.    Such examples include loading game menus through XML, generating 2D levels with    simple text files, and using other file formats to generate game levels, menus,    etc... The primary focus of this talk is to show implementations of code that pull    data from other sources to build simple games. Note, the specifics of XNA won't    be detailed in this discussion unless absolutely necessary.</p>
