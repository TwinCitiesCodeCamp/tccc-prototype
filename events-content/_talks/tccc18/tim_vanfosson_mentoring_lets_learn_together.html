<p>    Mentors are invaluable resources when you want to learn something. They help you ask the right questions, show you pitfalls and traps along the way, and generally make it easier to learn by letting you leverage their experience. This session will cover mentoring practices at The Nerdery from the perspective of the mentor and the person being mentored, our successes and failures, and how our practices have evolved over time. A small group activity will let each attendee contribute what has worked or not worked for them and form the basis of a round table discussion on best practices as a mentor/mentee.</p>
