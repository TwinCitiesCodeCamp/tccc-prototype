<p>    Are you a C# developer looking to get started in Objective-C for the first time? In this session, we'll explore the language with another C# developer who recently started to make the journey into the world of Objective-C. We’ll look at basic data types like strings, numbers and dates while looking at the differences between how classes, methods and properties are constructed in both languages.Throw in some tips and tricks for navigating around Xcode along with some online resources, and you’ll be ready to start digging into it on your own.</p>
