<p>    Web Essentials is an awesome extension for Visual Studio that adds incredible new features for web developers.  Vendor prefixes and visual feedback for browser support are two of many CSS related features.  Browser link creates a connection between a series of browsers and Visual Studio.  Changes in Visual Studio are immediately reflected in all connected browsers, and changes can be made directly in a browser and reflected in the source.  There are also a large number of enhancements to the HTML and JavaScript editors.  Web Essentials is a great way to get early access to great new features that may be eventually added to Visual Studio.</p>
