<p>    Docker containers running on Linux are all the rage – so much that <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/docker-and-microsoft-integrating-docker-with-windows-server-and-microsoft-azure" target="_blank">even Microsoft is paying attention</a>. What is all the fuss about? In this talk, we will discuss:</p><ul>    <li>What is Docker? Spoiler alert – it has nothing to do with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normcore" target="_blank">Normcore</a></li>    <li>Why is it so trendy?</li>    <li>Seriously, how might it actually be useful to developers?</li></ul><p>I will demonstrate how to build Docker images, test them in the privacy of my own laptop, and deploy them to the cloud. In the process I’ll show lots of fashionable stuff like ASP.NET vNext, Azure, Node.js, Microservice Architectures, GitHub, and Docker Hub at such a superficial level that it will frustrate the people in the room who actually understand these technologies. This is your chance to be on the bleeding edge, defined as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Docker-Up-Running-Karl-Matthias/dp/1491917571/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418143621&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=Docker" target="_blank">before the first O’Reilly book is published</a>.</p><p>Child Safety Warning: the demos will include typing in a Linux Bash shell. Not for the faint of heart, both for people who are GUI-oriented or who just can’t stand watching typing mistakes in live demos.</p>
