<p>    Who doesn’t want to get more done in less time?</p><p>    ASP.NET MVC gives us an excellent toolset for building web applications. Unfortunately, due to its rapid evolution, good documentation is hard to find. However, using some simple techniques, you can build user interface components that can speed up development while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.
