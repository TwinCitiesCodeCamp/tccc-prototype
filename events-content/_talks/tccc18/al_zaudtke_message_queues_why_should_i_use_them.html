<p>    Messaging systems are not new.  You may even be using one in some fashion already.  However, ask yourself the following questions.  Do you have scheduled jobs that require an IsSomething flag in your database?  Do you have tables that have more than 1 IsSomething Flag?  Do I have necessary duplicate data across my system?  How did you accomplish it?  Are my external processing tasks decoupled, scalable, or long running?  Are there pieces of my system that do not need to be real-time?  If you answered yes to any of these, this session is for you.</p><p>    This session will introduce you to the how and why of using a message queue.  We will not focus on the details of the messaging system, only the use of it.  Code demonstrations will be in C# using RabbitMQ as the messaging system.</p>
