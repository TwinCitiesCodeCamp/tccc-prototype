<p>    MongoDB is one of a number of “NoSQL” database servers that stores data as documents – represented in JSON – rather than the traditional columns/rows/tables model. It is designed to be very useful for certain use cases, but is a poor fit for others. In this presentation we will discuss what exactly MongoDB is, discuss what types of applications are appropriate for it and which types are not, and walk through the basics of installing, issuing queries and using indexes. No special experience is required but some familiarity with database concepts and JSON will be helpful.</p>
