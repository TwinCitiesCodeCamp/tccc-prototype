<p>    Elixir mixes functional language power with friendly syntax, and it turns out to be a fantastic way to work with data. The Phoenix framework gives you the power to build realtime apps with the same ease that Ruby on Rails did for database-driven apps a decade ago. In this session you'll learn about the basics of Elixir and see how to build a realtime collaborative app with Phoenix and some JavaScript. Elixir and Phoenix represent one possible future for web development. See how you can put it in use today.</p>
