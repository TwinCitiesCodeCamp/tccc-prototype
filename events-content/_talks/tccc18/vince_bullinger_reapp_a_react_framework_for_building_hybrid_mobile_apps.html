<p>    We've all heard of React, the JavaScript framework all the cool kids use nowadays. But Facebook recently announced the launched of Reapp. Reapp is a way to build "hybrid apps, fast."</p><p>    When most people think of hybrid apps, they think of PhoneGap. Reapp is the React way of building hybrid apps. Reapp creates hybrid apps by binding React to a cross-platform UI kit.</p><p>    In this session, we'll briefly go over React - in case anybody has missed the fun to date - before diving into the nuts and bolts of how to build hybrid mobile apps with Reapp, as well as briefly comparing the experience to other cross-platform mobile technologies.</p>
