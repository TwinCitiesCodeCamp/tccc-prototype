<p>    In this talk we’ll look take a look at WebRTC, a rather new technology that is giving Javascript developers the tools to add real-time communications to their applications without the need for plugins. We’ll examine the key components of this standard, look at how peer to peer connections are established, and discuss how you can start using it in your applications today using the Respoke Javascript library!</p>
