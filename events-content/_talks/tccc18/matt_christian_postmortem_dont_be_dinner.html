<p>    Learn about the trials and tribulations that went into development of the Windows 8 game Don’t Be Dinner from Subject Matter Games.  Built using Unity 4, Don’t Be Dinner is the team's first game and follows the many attempts of 5 medieval knights as they try to slay an evil troll with (often) disastrous results.  This talk will go into a behind the scenes look at development, do’s and don'ts on design and implementation, Unity code examples, and plenty of Q &amp; A.</p>
