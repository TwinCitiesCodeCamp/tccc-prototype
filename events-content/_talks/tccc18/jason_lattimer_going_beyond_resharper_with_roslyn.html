<p>    Most developers want to be able to write better code in less time which is why tools like ReSharper are so popular. If you've been keeping up on the latest from the Microsoft developer front you've probably heard about the .NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn"). Beyond having visibility into the inner workings of the compiler one of the main features is the set of code analysis APIs it provides. In this session we'll walk through using those APIs to create your own ReSharper-like code refactorings and code fixes using the latest CTP of Visual Studio 2015. With any luck you'll leave with some ideas on how you can use the .NET Compiler Platform to scratch a couple items off your own personal "I wish Visual Studio did this" list.</p>
