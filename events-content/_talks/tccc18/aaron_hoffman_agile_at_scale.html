<p>    For the past year I've been working in an environment with over 30 agile development teams all working simultaneously on the same product/platform. This has been a new experience for me as I am used to working in environments where only a couple agile teams are working together at any given time (and usually those teams are pioneering the methodology at that company, working along side teams developing software using a waterfall methodology.) Working with so many different agile teams simultaneously has been a very enlightening experience. Most of the usual battles new agile teams face have been fought and won, and new and interesting challenges arise. Come to this session to learn how 30 team, with over 300 repos, all work together on the same product and release functionality independently of each other.</p>
