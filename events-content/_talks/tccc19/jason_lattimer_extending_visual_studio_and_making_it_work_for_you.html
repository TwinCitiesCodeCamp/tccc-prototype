<p>	Did you know there's a Visual Studio SDK? By now everyone's heard talk of the .NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn") but there's also a world of other extensibility points in Visual Studio. Templates, menu commands, tool windows, and even customizations to the editor itself can all be tapped to add new functionality to keep you in the IDE longer making you more productive. There will be lots of demos to show off some of the features and the session will wrap up by  talking about getting an extension in the Visual Studio Gallery so it can be shared with the world.</p>
