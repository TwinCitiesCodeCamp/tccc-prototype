Interested in providing single sign-on experience across web your applications? Assuming you work in a Microsoft development stack and store user identities in Active Directory, this talk will show how to add a few open source components to the environment you (probably) already have and procure a platform for building claims-aware applications and enable Single Sign-On experience across your suite of apps. This talk would provide a primer on OAuth for web applications, OpenID connect, WS-Federation and how these technologies can be used to outsource authentication mechanism and also how it can used to provide coarse level authorization mechanism.
