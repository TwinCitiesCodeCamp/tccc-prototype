<p>    Inversion of Control (IoC) frameworks and libraries abound for the .NET framework.    These are very useful for decoupling service providers from service consumers. Exodata    takes this concept of decoupling providers from consumers and applies it to data    retrieval. An enhanced vocabulary for IoC in general will be introduced and numerous    code examples will be presented to explain what Exodata is, how it is implemented,    and practical ways that it can be used in real projects.</p>
