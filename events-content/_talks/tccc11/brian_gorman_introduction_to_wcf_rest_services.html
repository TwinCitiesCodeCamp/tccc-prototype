<p>    In this session, we'll discuss ground-up implementation of WCF Rest as a powerful    tool for interaction between projects and the database. We'll start by implementing    a service for error logging, and show how this service can be hosted in IIS, through    a windows service, and via AppHarbor. We'll focus on the methods that need to be    created, how to configure the service, and how to interact with the service. We'll    conclude by showing how to build a reusable library to easily implement server-side    ASP.Net and Winforms client interaction, as well as discuss using JQuery to interact    with the service on client-side web pages. Projects will be built in C#.net</p>
