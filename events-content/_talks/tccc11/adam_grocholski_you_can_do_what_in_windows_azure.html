<p>    You already know you can run your .NET based web sites, service, and applications    on Windows Azure, but this only scratches the surface of what you can do. Encoding    video with Expression Encoder, hosting adaptive streaming video in blob storage,    hosting multiple web sites, enabling remote desktop, creating a VPN and more are    all possible with the Windows Azure platform. In this demo intensive session I'll    show you how to do these things and more to unleash the power of Azure.</p>
