<p>    The mobile world has collided with your enterprise and now you are being told all    your internal applications need to go mobile, and depending on your environment,    it might be iPhones and iPads with iOS, Android phones or tablets, Windows Phones    and maybe HTML5 with anything else. Worst of all, most of the custom code you write    is in C# and who has time to learn and support Java, ObjectiveC and C#? Well, we've    got some answers for you using MonoTouch, Mono for Android and .NET/C#. In this    session we will build an MVC application with common Models and Controllers, but    will device specific Views for iOS, Android and Windows Phone 7 and if time allows    a HTML5 interface as well. Hold on it will be a wild ride!</p>
