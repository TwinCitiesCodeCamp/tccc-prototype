<p>    Clojure is a relatively new dialect of Lisp which runs on the JVM as well as the    CLR. Perhaps the most powerful feature of Lisp is its ability to define macros to    create syntactic abstractions. In this presentation, Kurt Christensen will explain    what macros are and why you might want to create them, along with some tips and    tricks for writing and debugging Clojure macros.</p>
