<p>    The web runs on CSS and JavaScript, but JavaScript can be clunky, and CSS is a mess.    Sass and CoffeeScript take these technologies and crank them up. In this talk, you'll    learn how to use CoffeeScript to build JavaScript applications using a concise but    powerful syntax. And you'll learn how to make your CSS much easier to maintain using    powerful Sass features like variables, functions, and iteration. Then we'll discuss    how to build these into your workflow so you can take advantage of them right now.</p>
