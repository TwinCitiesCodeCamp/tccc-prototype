<p>    You have heard the arguments. When you get down to it, it is all IL, right? Doesn't    that make C# and F# the same? Hogwash! In this talk, we will explore those areas    where F# has distinct advantages over F#, including:</p><ul>    <li>Immutability by default</li>    <li>Domain on a page</li>    <li>Pattern matching</li>    <li>Computation expressions</li>    <li>The eradication of null</li></ul><p>    Use what you learn from this talk to be able to, very confidently, make the case    for F# to your friends, your colleagues, and greater "powers-that-be". Or at least    understand why you should stop putting off that nagging "finally learn F#" to-do    item that has been in the back of your head all these years.</p>
