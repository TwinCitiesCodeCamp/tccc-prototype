<p>    In this session, we'll discuss popular and powerful design patterns, including the    Strategy pattern, Decorator pattern, and the Factory pattern. We'll use C# as our    language of choice during this session, however design patterns are language agnostic,    so any object-oriented programming language can implement these patterns. Design    patterns are very useful in your projects because they allow for more robust solutions    while minimizing the pain of maintenance and trouble-shooting, as well as minimizing    (eliminating?) repetitive code.</p>
