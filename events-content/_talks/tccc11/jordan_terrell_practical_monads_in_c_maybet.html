<p>    Blog posts and videos have had much to say about Monads. Learning about Monads often    leads to explanations full of complex mathematical and Haskell notations. This talk    will show the practical side of Monads - how they can be used in everyday programming    tasks. A brief amount of time will be spent on what a Monad is and what it is not,    as well as what Monads already exist in the .NET framework. This talk will focus    on demonstrating an implementation of the Maybe monad in C#, Maybe&lt;T&gt;, and    specific examples on how it can be used in your projects.</p>
