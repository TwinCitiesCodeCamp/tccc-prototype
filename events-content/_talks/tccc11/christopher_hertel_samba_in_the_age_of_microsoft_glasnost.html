<p>    Microsoft recently announced Version 2.2 of the venerable SMB network file system    protocol. Features of SMB2.2 include multipath support, cluster capabilities, distributed    caching, and SMB over RDMA--cool stuff. How will these advanced features impact    the storage market, and what jobs are likely to be created? How will the Samba Team--which    was at one point ahead of Microsoft in clustering features--respond? Most of all,    what does SMB2.2 actually look like on the wire and how do coders break into the    illusive SMB/CIFS/SMB2 development community?</p>
