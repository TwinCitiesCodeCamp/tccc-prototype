<p>    Javascript has been one of the most hated languages of modern times, but the emergence    of ajax has forced people to *gasp* actually learn the language. I'll talk about    the history of javascript from it's origins to the present and review the parts    of javascript that have allowed many developers to call a truce in the javascript    hate war and use it for serious web development. We'll focus on prototypical inheritance    and Javascript's features derived from functional programming models. At the end,    we will look at one terrible peice of code and transform it into something much    better.</p>
