<p>    We will unlock the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element and illustrate what can be accomplished    via its 2D API. Following a brief history of canvas, we will cover basic drawing    commands, matrix transformations, image processing via pixel manipulation, real-time    video effects, and show a step-by-step example of how to construct an animated scene    in canvas. The talk will also feature a comparison other web graphics technologies    such as Flash, and highlight the applications best suited for canvas.</p>
