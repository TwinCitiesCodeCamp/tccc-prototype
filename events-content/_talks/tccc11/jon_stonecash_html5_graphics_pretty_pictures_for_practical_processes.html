<p>    With the advent of HTML5 modern browsers can create advanced graphics on a web page.    The &lt;canvas&gt; and &lt;svg&gt; tags allow the web page to create sophisticated    charts and diagrams. These images are more than just pretty pictures. It is possible    to allow the user to interact with these images and to have these interactions affect    the more traditional elements of the web page such as form, input and control elements.    This presentation explores the possibilities and the mechanisms for integrating    interactive images into line of business web applications, using the canvas and    SVG elements plus a liberal dose of jQuery and JavaScript. The framework for demonstrating    these techniques will be ASP.NET MVC but the material can be used in any web server    technology.</p>
