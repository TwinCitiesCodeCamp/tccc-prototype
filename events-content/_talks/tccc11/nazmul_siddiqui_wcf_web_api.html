<p>    The REST service model has progressively gained industry wide exposure and WCF support    for it is no different, as it continues to inch toward becoming a first class service    model within the WCF environment. Web API is effectively the next WCF iteration    for REST support. While Web API offers a more comprehensive feature set on par with    SOAP based service models, upgrading from existing WCF REST model to the Web API    model is practically painless. The nearly ground up Web API service model intends    to bridge any remaining gaps when compared to its SOAP counterpart and push the    envelope. We'll introduce and explore the API in some detail with discussions, demos,    and samples.</p>
