<p>    OK, so you are aware what Apache Hadoop is, but you are struggling to understand    where and when it should be used? Is it a replacement for the database, part of    the "cloud", or useful for my problems? In this session we will briefly discuss    common Hadoop deployments both physical and virtual and then follow that up with    an in depth discussion of the code which implements two common use cases and one    unique use case. Learning by code, we will pick apart Data Warehouse Integration,    Cheap and Deep Storage, and Stitching Maps Together. All attendees will be given    the code discussed in class and a downloadable virtual machine ready to execute    the code examples discussed in class.</p>
