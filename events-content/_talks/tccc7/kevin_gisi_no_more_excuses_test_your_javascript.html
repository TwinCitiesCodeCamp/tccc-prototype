<p>    Javascript errors are nasty. All too often when a developer writes a web application,    they may write fantastic unit and functional tests, but forget that all-important    final layer of testing Javascript. Few enjoy debugging scripting errors, so we'll    take a look at how to use libraries like Screw.Unit, Smoke, JSpec, and JSocka to    help address those typos, errors, and even more dangerous design issues of "Doing    the wrong thing right."</p>
