<p>    Microsoft has embraced the popular jQuery open source JavaScript library, which    is already used by many major web sites. jQuery provides a very productive enivornment    for client side programming in JavaScript. It takes advantage of existing knowledge    of CSS selector syntax to offer a powerful and efficient alternative to the DOM.    The use of operation chaining and implicit iteration lead to a very compact and    productive syntax. The library is very lean at a mere 15K, yet provides a strong    base and a great extensibility model which has led to a large number of plugin extensions    to simplify web development. The session will review how to use the library for    very useful features such as watermarks, avoiding browser inconsistencies, and making    AJAX calls to the server. Several plug ins will be demonstrated which provide stunning    client experiences with as little as 1 line of code! We will also study how to extend    the library with our own custom utility funcitons and plug ins. Learn how Jquery    and the Microsoft AJAX Library JavaScript libraries greatly simplify client side    development, and which to use for particular scenarios.</p>
