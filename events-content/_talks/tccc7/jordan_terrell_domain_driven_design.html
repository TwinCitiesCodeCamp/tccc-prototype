<p>    Domain Driven Design (DDD) has steadily become more visible to the broader software    development community, and offers some unique approaches to developing complex business    applications. This session will introduce you to the basic concepts of DDD, as well    as some updated thoughts by the author of "Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity    in Software", by Eric Evans. This session will focus primarily on DDD concepts,    but will also present an implementation example developed on the .NET platform.</p>
