<p>    The Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) keeps showing up in an increasing number    of areas. Whether it is heard in the context of Prism, RIA Services, the MVC framework    or even Visual Studio 2010, MEF is mentioned as a core enabling technology. Some    people have even used MEF as an IoC container. In MEF everything is an extension    and everything is an extensible â€“ including the extensions themselves. This introduction    is focused on describing what MEF is (and equally important - what it isn't), we'll    walk through a real-world scenario of changing an application to use MEF and get    a glimpse at how MEF will change how we think about application composition.</p>
