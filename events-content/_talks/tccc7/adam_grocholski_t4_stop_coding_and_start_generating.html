<p>    Did you know Visual Studio 2008 comes with a code generator? Well it does, and you    should learn to use it so you can stop writing repetitive code (i.e. DTO's and DAL's)    and generate it. Come to this session to learn about the Text Template Transformation    Toolkit (T4). T4 allows you to use simple ASP.NET-like template syntax to generate    application source code, configuration files, stored procedures and more. This session    will give you all the information you need to start using T4 effectively in your    project, TODAY! We will go from basics (such as T4 template syntax) to advanced    topics (such as template design and use of T4 in large projects) stopping along    the way to create several templates from scratch.</p><p>    This will be a PowerPoint free presentation. No slides, just code!</p>
