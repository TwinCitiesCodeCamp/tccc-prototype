<p>    Come learn about Ruby, and how it's much more than Rails. Ruby is a dynamic, fully    object-oriented language that borrows from Perl, Smalltalk, and LISP, but provides    a clean, simple syntax usable by hobbiests, but enough power to be used by some    of the most hardcore metaprogrammers in the world. Ruby has caught the attention    of Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, and Sun, powers sites like Yellowpages.com and Hulu,    and is an absolute joy to work with. In this presentation, you'll learn the fundamentals    of Ruby, and you'll see it in action as we build a simple web service using the    Sinatra microframework, a static web site with StaticMatic, and we'll test a web    site using Cucumber and our browser. Ruby is a lot more than Rails, so come learn    about it today!</p>
