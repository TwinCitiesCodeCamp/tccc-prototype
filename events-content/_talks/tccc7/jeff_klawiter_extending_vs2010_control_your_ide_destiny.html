<p>    Microsoft has made a giant leap with Visual Studio 2010. Moving to a WPF interface    and majorly overhauling the process of adding and managing extensions. The inclusion    of the new VSIX package model and built in managed classes for interacting with    the Editor. It has never been easier to integrate your interface ideas into your    IDE. This track will cover VSIX packages, some of the editor Adorners, debugging    your extension and implementing some more advanced features like Menu Commands and    Tool Windows.</p>
