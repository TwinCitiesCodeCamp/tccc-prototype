<p>    The world is changing fast, and Microsoft is committed to the new Windows Runtime    (WinRT) development platform on Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, and perhaps elsewhere.    The CSLA .NET framework is one of the most widely used open source development frameworks    for the Microsoft .NET framework, and CSLA 4 version 4.5 supports .NET 4.5 and WinRT    development. In this session you will learn how to create applications leverage    CSLA .NET to encapsulate all business, validation, and authorization logic so that    logic is available to applications written using WFP, ASP.NET, and the new WinRT    platform. Those WinRT applications can then deploy to Intel and ARM-based Windows    8 devices such as tablets, ultrabooks, laptops, and desktop computers.</p>
