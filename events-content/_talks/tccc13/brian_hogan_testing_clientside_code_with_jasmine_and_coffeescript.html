<p>    As we move more and more important code from the server onto the client, we need    to ensure that code is well designed and well-tested. A simple mistake can cause    the entire user interface to fail in spectacular ways. This book will give you the    grounding you need to develop test-first client-side code so you can avoid messes    and have more confidence in your applications. In this talk, you'll learn to use    CoffeeScript and the Jasmine testing library to develop solid, testable client-side    code. We'll cover how to create encapsulated code, how to stub out remote calls,    and how to automate the test suite so it can run automatically in the background    or as part of a continuous integration server. If you write client side code but    need to know how to test it, this talk is for you.</p>
