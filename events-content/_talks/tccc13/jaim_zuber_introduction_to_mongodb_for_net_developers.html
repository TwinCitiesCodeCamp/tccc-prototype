<p>    MongoDB and other NoSQL databases have been around long enough for the hype to wear    off. MongoDB promises greater flexibility and scalability compared to relational    (SQL) data stores and has backed that claim up with a growing list of high profile    deployments. But how does a dev steeped in .NET &amp; SQL Server go about figuring out    if it's right for their project? In this session you'll learn how to harness the    flexibility &amp; scalability of MongoDB in .NET without giving up all of the knowledge    you've learned in the relational world.</p>
