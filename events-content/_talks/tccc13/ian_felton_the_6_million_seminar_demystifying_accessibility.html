<p>    Can your company afford to take a $6 million hit? That’s how much Target paid in    2008 to settle a lawsuit claiming its website was not accessible to the blind. Avoid    having your company become a Target by learning more about this growing topic in    a compact 60 minutes. In the first half, Ian will focus on the what and why of accessibility;    in the second half, he’ll show you how to use JavaScript and WAI-ARIA to make your    website more accessible. A solid understanding of HTML and JavaScript is recommended.</p>
