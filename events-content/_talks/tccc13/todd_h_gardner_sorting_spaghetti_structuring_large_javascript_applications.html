<p>    More and more of our code is moving into the web; and into JavaScript. But we quickly    find ourselves in a nested mess of jQuery callbacks, tangled dependencies, and global    events. In this session we will transform, step-by-step, a "classic" JavaScript    application into a tested, structured, and modular application using QUnit, Sinon,    Backbone, and Require.js.</p>
