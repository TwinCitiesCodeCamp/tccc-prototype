<p>    The C++ Renaissance is a time of renewed interest in C++; particularly by young    developers. Interest in C++ has increased as trends of using “modern” language semantics,    and object-oriented programming concepts play a bigger role in C++ applications.    In this presentation; you will learn what has changed in C++ since win32, and how    C++ can be used for creating abstract data models, and even (GASP!) cross-platform    software development! If we have time I might also go into C++AMP at the end of    the presentation.</p>
