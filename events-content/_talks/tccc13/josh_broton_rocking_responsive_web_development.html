<p>    Up until the last few years, it was completely acceptable to design/develop a new    website for one size of monitor. But with the release of the iPhone, iPad and other    mobile devices, we've witnessed the beginning of a mobile revolution. By the end    of this year, over 50% of Americans will use their phone or tablet as their primary    web browsing device. The question is, are the sites that you are creating ready?    In this talk, I'll talk about reasons why responsive is the best way to develop    new websites, as well as the best techniques I've discovered after a year of full    time development of responsive websites.</p>
