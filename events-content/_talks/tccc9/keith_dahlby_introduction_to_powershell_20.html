<p>    PowerShell is Microsoft's next-generation command-line shell and scripting language.    This session will discuss why you need it, how to use it, and what makes it different    from any other shell on any platform. Beyond its traditional uses for system administration,    PowerShell provides full access to .NET for Read-Eval-Print loops (REPL), rapid    prototyping, object exploration and extensibility. After an overview of language    features and what's new in version 2.0, we dive into an interactive demo, so come    prepared with questions you have or problems we can solve together.</p>
