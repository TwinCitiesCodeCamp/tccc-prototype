<p>    See how you can leverage the dynamic nature of C# and .NET to provide an intuitive    and extensible programming model for the current (and upcoming) crop of many-core    architectures (including GPGPU). The presentation will show you code samples, performance    comparisons; discuss optimization, extensibility and flexibility. You will also    be shown where and how you can get this open-source library and use it in your own    commercial/non-commercial application.</p>
