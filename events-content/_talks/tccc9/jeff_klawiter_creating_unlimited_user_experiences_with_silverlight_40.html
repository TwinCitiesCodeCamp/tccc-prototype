<p>    Silverlight remains one of the few rich client architectures that provide a very    strict separation of presentation and logic. Using TemplateParts and VisualStates    an application can maintain the same functionality while providing wildly different    interfaces. Utilizing Blend, Open Source and Programmer "design" we will create    an application with templated controls, creating new themes and provide ways to    download them on the fly.</p>
