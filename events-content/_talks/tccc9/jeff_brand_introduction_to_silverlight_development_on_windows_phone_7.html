<p>    Take a look at how you can get started developing applications for Windows Phone    7 Series using the free downloadable tools that are now available. Starting off    with an overview of the Windows Phone platform, we'll then cover the new application    model, developing apps, leveraging services unique to the phone, and more. This    session is very "demo heavy" with most of our time spent building an application    that shows off the various phone features.</p>
