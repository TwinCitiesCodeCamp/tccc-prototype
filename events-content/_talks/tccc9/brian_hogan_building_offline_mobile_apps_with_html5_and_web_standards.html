<p>    Interested in developing an app for the iOS devices AND the Android platforms? What    about an app that also works on Windows, OSX, and Linux? With new features in HTML5,    you can build database-backed applications that run completely in the browser using    nothing more than HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In this talk, you'll see how to build    a very simple app that will work on multiple platforms, and even work without a    network connection. Don't let app stores or complex languages keep you from building    apps for mobile devices. Come see how easy it can be!</p>
