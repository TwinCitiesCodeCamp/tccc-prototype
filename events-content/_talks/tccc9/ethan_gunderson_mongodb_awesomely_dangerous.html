<p>    MongoDB is a scalable, high-performance, open-source, document-oriented database.    It merges the speed of a key-value store, and the feature set of an RDBMS, but it    isn't all puppies and rainbows. This talk will cut through the hype, and go over    some of the fundamentals of Mongo, and then go into some of the more interesting    features. We'll then go over problem scenarios where Mongo really shines, and then    some of the gotchyas and trade offs you'll encounter. You'll leave the session with    a better understanding of when you should be using Mongo (and when you shouldn't),    allowing you to make informed decisions on your next project.</p>
