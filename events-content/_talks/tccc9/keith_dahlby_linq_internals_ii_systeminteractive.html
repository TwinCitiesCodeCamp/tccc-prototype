<p>    System.Interactive is a library distributed with Microsoft's Reactive Extensions,    currently available on DevLabs, which provides a number of useful extensions to    the LINQ Standard Query Operators. These extensions include operators to add and    contain side effects, handle exceptions, generate and combine sequences, and much    more. This session will review the new operators and discuss interesting problems    they can be used to solve. Note that Rx is available for .NET 3.5 SP1, Silverlight    3 and .NET 4.0, so this session is not just for those developing on the bleeding    edge.</p>
