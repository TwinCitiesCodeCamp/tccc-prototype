<p>    Box2D is the most powerful and widely used physics engine for online games. It allows    developers to quickly create dynamic, life like, environments for their application.    In this session we'll cover everything you need to get started with the latest version    of Box2D for ActionScript. Learn how to create a 2D world, add objects and apply    forces. All source code for the demo will be provided and we'll finish with an example    of Box2D running on the Nexus One with Adobe AIR!</p>
