<p>    In certain .NET circles there has been a lot of talk as of late about the Managed    Extensibility Framework, or MEF. You may have even heard some of this chatter, but    you're probably asking yourself "What the heck is MEF and why should I care?" At    its core, MEF is a library for creating lightweight, extensible applications. MEF    is an integral part of the .NET Framework, and Silverlight 4 shipped with out-of-the    box support for MEF. In this session we'll dive into the guts of MEF looking at    what it is, why you might want to consider using it, and how to actual implement    MEF in your Silverlight applications.</p>
