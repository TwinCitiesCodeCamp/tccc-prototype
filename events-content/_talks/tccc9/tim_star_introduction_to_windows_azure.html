<p>    If Cloud computing is "the next big thing" in web development what do we, the developer,    need to do to prepare to write applications that will run on the Windows Azure platform?    In this session we will take a look at what Windows Azure is and how developing    applications for deployment in the cloud differs from writing applications that    are hosted onsite. We will look at the Development Fabric which simulates the Windows    Azure fabric on your local computer so that you can run and test your service locally    before deploying it to the cloud. We will also take a look at the Windows Azure    storage options including queues, tables, blobs, and SQL Azure. Finally we'll use    the dev fabric to write a simple application that may be deployed to the cloud.</p>
