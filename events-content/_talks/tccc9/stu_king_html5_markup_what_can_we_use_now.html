<p>    All the hype would suggest that HTML5 will someday replace plugin based technologies    for the web like Flash and SilverLight but what can you safely use today? How will    HTML5 affect the popular page layout patterns we have all come to expect on the    web? How can we use features in the HTML5 spec to build better page layouts? We    will also touch on closely related specifications for HTML5 such as W3C's ARIA (Accessible    Rich Internet Application) and learn how to build richer more accessible forms by    extending the semantics of HTML5 even further.</p>
