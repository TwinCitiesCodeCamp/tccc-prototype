<p>    Relational databases have dominated as the solution for data storage and retrieval    for decades in application development. But, all along in the fringe and recently    rising to popularity are a whole class of alternatives. This session covers the    range of technologies that are going under the banner NoSQL (Not Only SQL). Find    out what makes these different from the SQL database systems you're probably more    used to and where they fit as solutions and whether something like RavenDB, DB4O    or MongoDB might work for your next project.</p>
