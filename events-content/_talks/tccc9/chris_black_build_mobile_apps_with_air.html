<p>    Building cross platform applications for mobile devices has never been easier. The    latest version of Adobe AIR has APIs for multi-touch, gestures, geo location and    the accelerometer. This technology is available today on many Android devices and    will soon be supported by 19 of the top 20 cell phone manufacturers. In this session    we'll go over everything you'll need to build, test and deploy high performance    mobile applications. The end result will be a file that can be submitted to the    Android Marketplace for sale.</p>
