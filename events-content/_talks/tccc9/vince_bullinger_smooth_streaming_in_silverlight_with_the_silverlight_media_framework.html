<p>    The Silverlight Media Framework was developed from best practices learned from the    development of such notable implementations of smooth streaming with Silverlight    as the Olympics, Wimbledon, Sunday Night Football and the Tour de France. In this    session, we'll go over the SMF, when you should use it and we'll finish by building    an app that highlights the most fun and interesting elements of SMF.</p>
