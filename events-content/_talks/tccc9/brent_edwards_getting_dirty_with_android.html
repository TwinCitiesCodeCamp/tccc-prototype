<p>    You've learned how to get set up to develop for the Android platform and how to    publish an app. Eclipse is all ready to go and you've got a killer idea. Now what?    In this session, we will talk about many of the key concepts you will need to understand    to develop good applications for the Android platform. We will discuss concepts    such as layout, styling, asynchronous tasks, lifecycle management, menus, dialogs    and custom graphics. This will be a code-heavy session where we will be getting    our hands dirty to illustrate these concepts in action.</p>
