<p>    So you have seen a few sessions on F# that introduce the concept. Maybe you are    now excited about functional programming - or maybe you need a little more convincing    to really see how it is used in the "real world". Come to this session, and see    examples of useful F# applications that can potentially have real impact on humanity.    In the session, we will cover the following topics:</p><ul>    <li>Using F# based Monte-Carlo simulation to avoid another global financial crisis</li>    <li>        â€¢ Using F# based Natural Language Processing to solve the problem of "incivility        on the Internet"    </li></ul><p>    As we go through these examples, you will see how F# is particularly useful for    solving these types of problems that involve simulation and categorization.</p>
