<p>    There are tons of great MVC web frameworks out in the wild, for most major compiled    and dynamic languages. They're great tools to get projects prototyped and quickly    into production. The Ambition MVC framework is a hobby that turned into a reasonable    web framework. Written using Vala, the Ambition framework allows a developer or    team of developers to create web applications or RESTful services using a static-typed    object oriented language without relying on a VM or a garbage collection cycle.    Plus, being compiled, it allows cloud deployment to be easy and inexpensive, as    memory and CPU requirements can be a fraction of PHP, Ruby, Python, or Perl sites.    While it's not "officially" released, it's available on GitHub, and being actively    developed. Patches, help, and end users are very welcome, and I'd like to show you    more.</p>
