<p>    You may have seen the theoretical discussions of Reactive Extensions and heard about    the duality of IEnumerable and IObservable, but are still scratching your head to    know how and when to use them. In demo filled session, we'll cover a number of cases    where it makes sense to consider RX to declaratively compose complex operations    over observable sequences in an elegant LINQ like syntax. We may even have some    chocolate induced audience participation along the way.</p>
