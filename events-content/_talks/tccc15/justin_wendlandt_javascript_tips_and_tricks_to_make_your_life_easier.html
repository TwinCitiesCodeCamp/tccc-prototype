<p>    Anyone who has developed for the web has run into JavaScript. It is a language that    was first standardized right around the same year I graduated high school (1996).    After 10 years of developing applications with C#, I find myself missing certain    aspects of the .NET Framework and the C# language that I really wished existed in    JavaScript. This talk will go over several aspects of JavaScript from the perspective    of a C# guy. We will review tips and tricks to make life easier, software engineering    patterns to increase code quality and general guidelines to make JavaScript more    maintainable.</p>
