<p>    In this live coding demo, we’re going to start where most introduction Windows Phone    development tutorials leave off, which is: what do you do after you have your basic    app working? How do you leverage MVVM, add offline capability, cache data, handle    logging &amp; exceptions, and polish it for a great user experience? We’ll take an existing    basic application (mine, in fact) and enhance it while I share tips, tricks, and    gotchas related to building a fully realized Windows Phone app that will help you    level up your existing application and learn what it takes to build a real live    app.</p>
