<p>    Umbraco is free and open source CMS with a great developer community that has been    around for a while, but has recently started to really pick up traction. In this    presentation, Ken will show you an overview of the features of the CMS, and walk    through the basic steps for creating an Umbraco site, covering Document Types, Templates,    Macros, and the programmability behind each of these features.</p>
