<p>    You may be under the impression that Service Oriented Architecture means building    SOAP-based web services as a middleware for your application, which is painful and    difficult to manage long term. Come learn a better way to employ the true power    of SOA via asynchronous messaging with the NServiceBus, a .NET Enterprise Service    Bus. You will learn about the differences between different application and systems    integration options and architectural styles, and how a Service Bus architectural    style can help you to cut down the complexity of a system to deliver truly scalable    and manageable distributed solutions.</p>
