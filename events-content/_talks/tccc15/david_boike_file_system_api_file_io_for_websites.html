<p>    HTML5 has brought us many new ways to deliver rich content to the web. The File    System API is one way we can enable offline applications that deal with actual files    in a sand boxed environment for a site. It allows us to store binary files such    as documents, images, and even JSON. The files can then be referenced with file    system URIs to deliver them to the user, build the site itself, or even serve data    using XHR. Learn the basics of the API, dealing with browser compatibility or lack    there of, common use cases, and see tools to help you build your app in this code-centric    presentation. Here is the tests and app I will be reviewing to cover the API: <a href="https://github.com/StephenErstad/FileSystemApiDemo" target="_blank">StephenErstad/FileSystemApiDemo</a>.    It can be run as a Node or .NET web app.</p>
