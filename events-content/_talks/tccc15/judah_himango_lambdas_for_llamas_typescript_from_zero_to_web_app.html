<p>    JavaScript for big apps on the web has never been a great proposition. Enter TypeScript:    application-scale JavaScript development. Use TypeScript to whip your web app's    complexity into shape using types, modules, classes, and more. In this talk, we'll    build a web app from scratch using TypeScript to see what this language is all about.    Fun with lambdas and llamas.</p>
