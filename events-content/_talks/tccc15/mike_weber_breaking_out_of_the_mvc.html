<p>    Ruby on Rails, and other Model/View/Controller based frameworks, are great tools    for quickly creating web applications. Unfortunately the MVC is not a one-size-fits-all    pattern and it tends to point developers away from proper object-oriented design.    We'll talk about how to organize code beyond the MVC, decoupling application logic    from the MVC, and when it's best to use a Service Layer instead of Models. While    the talk will mostly focus on Rails, we'll be discussing established object-oriented    programming principles and these ideas should be applicable to anyone working with    an MVC-based framework.</p>
