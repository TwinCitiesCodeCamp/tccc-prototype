<p>    Single Page Application (SPA) with WebAPI, Knockout, and Breeze. Many of us have    been using AJax for a long time to make our web applications modern and responsive.    In this presentation I will demonstrate how to develop your entire UI with client    side javascript, css, and html, using WebAPI for back end database interaction and    middle tier logic. This presentation uses a combination of javascript libraries,    including JQuery, Knockout, BreezeJS, History.JS, and Q-Js. These libraries make    writing SPA applications easier than ever, with client side data binding and observable    javascript objects among other features.
