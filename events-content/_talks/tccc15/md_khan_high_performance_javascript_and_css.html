<p>    The entire web is married to JavaScript. That’s not the fact. Fact is the guys who    are cooking for the web, is crazy about JavaScript. Hence, you cannot imagine a    single website (desktop or mobile) without JavaScript. Saving the marriage is not    an option when your world is occupied by your better half in loading resources,    delicious libraries, fancy charts/ visualization, two way binding, interactions    with DOM, responsive U,I so and so on... When JavaScript do the core work like (grocery,    taking dogs to walk/ kids to child care, weekends/ vacation plan, marathon shopping)    CSS makes your site interesting. CSS performance is the silent killer that we always    ignore. The goal of this talk is not to save the marriage rather to make the marriage    most enjoyable, highly interesting and tremendously performing. High performance    doesn’t have to some miracle that somehow works. After this talk, you would be the    guy who rocks for high performance JavaScript and CSS. And you will believe, high    performance code could reusable, readable and maintainable.</p>
