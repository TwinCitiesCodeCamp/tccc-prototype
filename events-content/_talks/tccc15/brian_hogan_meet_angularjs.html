<p>    Angular.JS from Google introduces a radically different way to build things for    the web with HTML and JavaScript. In this talk, we'll take a look at the basic and    most useful features of Angular as we build some simple apps and widgets we're already    familiar with using new techniques. We'll look at Angular's support for data binding,    services, directives, and testing. And we'll also talk about where Angular isn't    a good fit.</p>
