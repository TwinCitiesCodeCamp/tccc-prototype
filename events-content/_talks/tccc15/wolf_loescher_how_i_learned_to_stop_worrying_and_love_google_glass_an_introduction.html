<p>    Google Glass has acquired mindshare as the first viable mainstream commercial "wearable    computing" product. But for all the excitement (especially amongst the technorati),    there is a lot of fear and doubt. What's it like to wear this thing all day? What    can you do with it? What *can't* you do with it? When can I get one? How do I develop    for it? Will it make me blind and/or sterile? Join Wolf Loescher to discus the good,    the bad, and the the ugly about Google Glass.</p>
