<p>    What is IOC? You’ve no doubt heard the term thrown around by seasoned developers.    They sing of its usefulness and power – but when you try to learn it, it all seems    to go over your head. That was me a few years ago. I finally made a concerted effort    to really learn IOC and see what all these smart people were raving about. In this    session, I will share my knowledge of IOC and try to help you understand why Inversion    of Control is as good as the alpha geeks say it is.</p>
