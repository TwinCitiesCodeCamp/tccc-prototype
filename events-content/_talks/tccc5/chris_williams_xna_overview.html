<p>    This session will cover what XNA is (and isn't) along with what's needed to develop    with both XNA 2.0 and the 3.0 beta. We will also cover key differences between the    two versions along with the features and limitations of each. Target platforms of    Windows, XBOX 360 and Zune will be discussed. We'll go through some demos and take    a look at some code, identifying key aspects of the XNA Framework and game development.</p>
