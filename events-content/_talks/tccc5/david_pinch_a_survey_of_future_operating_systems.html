<p>    This presentation will compare three operating systems built around a managed (.NET)    kernel: Microsoft Singularity, SharpOS, and Cosmos. Singularity is an effort from    the Microsoft Research Group; Cosmos and SharpOS are open source kernels. All three    kernels are under development but already provide an insight into the future of    computer systems and design. This presentation will discuss the approaches behind    each kernel and then demonstrate how to compile and create applications for each.</p>
