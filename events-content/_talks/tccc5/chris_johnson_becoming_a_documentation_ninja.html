<p>    <a href="http://www.napcsweb.com/blog/2008/10/13/tccc_docbook_slides/">        Presentation        Materials    </a></p><p>    Have you ever wondered if their was an easier way to maintain your documentation?    Would you like to be able to generate custom documentation at the push of a button?    DocBook is a great tool for creating and maintaining documentation. DocBook allows    you to keep all of your documentation consistent and up to date with ease. DocBook    is "a schema (available in several languages including RELAX NG, SGML and XML DTDs,    and W3C XML Schema) maintained by the DocBook Technical Committee of OASIS." In    this session we will show you how to set up a DocBook project and use it to its    full potential for you and your company. We will show you how to use the DocBook    build chain to produce custom documents to ship to your clients and use the same    files to build different documents for your developers.</p>
