<p>    This talk assumes you know the basics of the ASP.NET MVC framework.</p><p>    Since ASP.NET MVC gets rid of Viewstate and the postback model, most existing server    controls aren't very useful for MVC related development. The ASP.Net MVC team has    built in a whole set of helper methods to accelerate building your views, but there    is more that can be done to make ui design more effective in the ASP.NET MVC framework.</p><p>    In the newer generation of browsers (Internet Explorer 7+, Firefox 2+, Safari 3,    Opera 9 and Chrome .2) there has been significant improvements with JavaScript rendering    speed. This means that rendering controls on the client side is much more feasible    and efficient. We're going to leverage functionality and components from two different    JavaScript libraries (jQuery and YUI), to make our ASP.NET MVC websites more expressive    and functional.</p><p>    Most of the techniques used in this talk with YUI and jQuery could be used in Webforms    development with a little modification.</p>
