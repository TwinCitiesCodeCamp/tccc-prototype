<p>    Save time, reduce defects, and eliminate boring, repetitive work and dependence    on "tribal knowledge" using a Continuous Integration framework in your project.    This session will explain the concepts if Continuous Integration, explore the benefits    of this practice, and provide a "getting started cookbook" for introducing Continuous    Integration framework to your project, no matter what phase it is in. A demonstration    of automating a build, introducing some automated testing, and running the build    will conclude the session.</p>
