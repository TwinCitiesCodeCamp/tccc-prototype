<p>    <a href="http://aspadvice.com/blogs/robertb/archive/2008/10/21/Twin-Cities-Code-Camp-Fall-2008-Handouts.aspx">        Presentation Material    </a></p><p>    Do you need to get a web site setup quickly? Why code all the pages yourself when    you can use the ASP.NET Dynamic Data to build the initial pages based on your data    schema? This new feature creates the .aspx pages for you based on your data. The    pages can be used directly, or you can customize the pages to add your own look    and feel. You can augment the data model for the site to include information that    can automatically create the necessary validation controls! Included are a set of    Field Template controls that are user controls to edit particular types of data,    these can be customized once and apply to all page templates used on the site. Don't    start with nothing when you need to create a new site, take advantage of the ASP.NET    Dynamic Data support to have a functional site very quickly and simply customize    it to get a great site!</p>
