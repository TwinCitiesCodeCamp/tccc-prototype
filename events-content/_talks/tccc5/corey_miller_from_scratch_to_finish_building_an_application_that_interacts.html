<p>    <a href="http://www.coreysportfolio.com/post/2008/10/Twin-Cities-Code-Camp-Source.aspx">        Presentation Material    </a></p><p>    In this session I'll build an application from scratch to finish, skipping through    the basics and jumping into advanced techniques to get the most out of Silverlight    2. I'll build an interactive image viewer and slideshow presenter in VS2008 that    will cover advanced techniques that range from custom controls using the parts model    to local storage for personalization.</p>
