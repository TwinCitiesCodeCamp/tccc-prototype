<p>    <a href="http://www.jeffknutson.net/downloads/codecamp5.zip">Presentation Materials</a></p><p>    Security. The very word generates strong reactions from ALL developers, most often    negative. Is security really such a bad thing? Is security hard? As a rank-and-file    developer, why should I care about security? In this session, I will talk about    reasons to care about security, show how to find security holes in applications,    show ways to fix these holes, and demonstrate techniques to improve the application    security. This session assumes no prior working knowledge of security, encryption,    or any other $0.25 words that seem hard. Think of this session as application developer    security 101.</p>
