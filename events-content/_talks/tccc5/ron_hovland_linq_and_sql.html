<p>    A .Net developer has always been able to query a dataset by using a DataView and    filtering; however, in order to build in the flexibility an application needs, quite    often programmers simply make new calls to the database--potentially causing performance    degradation. Linq allows the developer to more easily manipulate in-memory data    objects, whether from a database, xml, or application specific. This session will    introduce attendees to these features, their requirements and constraints.</p>
