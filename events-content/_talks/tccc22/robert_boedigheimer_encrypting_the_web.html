Does your entire web site require HTTPS?  If it doesn't now, it better soon!  The Chrome team just announced starting in July 2018 it will label all HTTP pages as "not secure".  Most browsers also require HTTPS to use new features like HTTP/2, service workers, and progressive web apps.   Discover the many benefits of using HTTPS beyond just confidentiality, including integrity and trust.  Review adoption strategies, including how to use HTTP response headers such as Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) and Content-Security-Policy.  Learn about he misconceptions around HTTPS, and that it isn't as hard to implement as you think.
