As software developers, solving puzzles or finding answers to problems, is an energy source. We love it. We crave it. We code. That drive requires we be equipped with tools that allow us to get better every day at our craft.  One tool that can help us in our daily cyber-strife is a nose for detecting bad, smelly code.  The goal of this talk is to start you off on a path to improve your skills to find & fix bad code. In addition, we will share with you various resources, on-line tools, techniques and styles that can help you sharpen your skills for detecting bad code and administering the best possible antidotes to correct problems in the code you work on... whatever that code may be: legacy, brown-field or green-field (maybe we can exclude museum-worthy code).
