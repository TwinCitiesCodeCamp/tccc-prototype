Visual Studio App Center is a the hub of “continuous everything” for you apps: Build, UI test, distribute (think HockeyApp 2.0), see usage analytics and crash reports, and manage push notifications - all in one place.
We’ll dive deep into the features, see App Center in action on a few apps, and most importantly, show how you can use App Center to release more frequently, with higher quality, and HAVE MORE FUN, by spending time on coding features instead of clicking buttons and managing overhead.
