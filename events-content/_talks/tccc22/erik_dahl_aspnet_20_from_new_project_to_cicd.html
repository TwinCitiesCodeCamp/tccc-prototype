New to ASP.NET Core 2.0?  Or haven't yet seen it all the way through Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment?  In this session we will cover ASP.NET Core 2.0 - benefits of using it and when not to, then look at the project templates (dotnet new and in VS 2017), then look at a simple but real application to search and view log entries from a SQL Server database.  The technology used includes Dapper, Bootstrap, jQuery, Kendo UI Core (open source), and TypeScript.  We'll explore this application and then look at what it took to enable full CI/CD within Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).
