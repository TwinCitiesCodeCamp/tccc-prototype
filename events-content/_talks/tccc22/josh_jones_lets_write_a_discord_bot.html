Discord is a popular VOIP and chat application used by gaming communities and streamers.  In this talk, I'll show you how to get started writing your own bot that interfaces with the service.  We'll cover how to get your application registered, how to get an API key, the libraries available for your particular language, and conclude with a live demo showing the creation of a simple bot from start to finish.
