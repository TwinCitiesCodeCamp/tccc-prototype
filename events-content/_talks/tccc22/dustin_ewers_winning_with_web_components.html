The bar for web development continues to increase. While web frameworks proliferate, the rise of the mobile web has made performance a major concern. Fortunately, web standards have evolved. A new set of web standards, collectively referred to as web components, give us the ability to make custom HTML elements.

With web components, you can build your own suite of custom elements that work with any JavaScript framework (or none at all). Angular, React, Vue, ShinyNewFramework.js... doesn't matter. You can build a single set of components and use them accross all of your sites. Because they are native browser constructs, applications built with web components also render quickly.

In this talk, you will learn about the web components standard and how to use them in your application. You'll learn about the why web components are useful, some libraries that can help you build them, and how to integrate them in your own applications. By the end of this talk, you'll be ready to build your own suite of web components.
