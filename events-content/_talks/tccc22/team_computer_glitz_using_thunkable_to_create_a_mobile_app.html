Thunkable was developed by MIT  as a 2nd generation of App Inventor to create mobile apps.  Thunkable is simple and fast for first-time app builders, but powerful enough to support your most ambitious apps.  We will show how to develop and test a simple Android mobile app.  We will show how to use a phone's local database or a Fusion Table of Data on the Cloud for app data.  We'll talk about some of the apps we've created and show you resources where you can learn more to help you make your own Android mobile app.  Developing mobile apps with Thunkable is fun.  This session will make you want to go home and make your own.
