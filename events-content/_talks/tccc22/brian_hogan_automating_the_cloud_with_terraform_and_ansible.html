Need a web infrastructure for your project?  Setting everything up by hand is tedious, and prone to problems. That's why more and more people are moving to immutable infrastructure with Terraform and Ansible.  Terraform lets you create server instances, and Ansible lets you provision them with users, software, and configuration.

In this talk, you'll see how to build a web server infrastructure using Ansible, Terraform.  First, you'll see how to define and create servers with code using Terraform. Then you'll see how to use Ansible Playbooks to provision a webserver and upload the web site. Finally, you'll see how to scale this infrastructure.  When we're done, you'll have scripts you can run to set up your own environment.
