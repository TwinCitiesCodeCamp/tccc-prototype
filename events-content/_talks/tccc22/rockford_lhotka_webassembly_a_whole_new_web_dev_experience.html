<p>Web development is about to undergo a major change! For many years now people have tried to create new web development languages and experiences on top of JavaScript. This was done by transpiling or compiling code into JavaScript.<p>

<p>Now there's an exciting new option: WebAssembly. All modern browsers now have the ability to run assembly language AND JavaScript, which means a lot of existing languages can now run in the browser. Languages such as C, Go, and even C#.</p>

<p>If you've held off on web development because of JavaScript, or been a reluctant JavaScript user, WebAssembly offers you alternatives. The browser is no longer a mono-culture, and the future is very exciting!</p>
