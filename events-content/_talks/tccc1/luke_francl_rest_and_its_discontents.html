<p>    Representational State Transfer or REST has gained a lot of mind share as an alternative    to SOAP-based web services. REST describes a resource-based architecture that mirrors    the web. "It's just XML over HTTP" is a common refrain. But as you did deeper, REST    becomes more complicated. Debates about the "right" and "wrong" ways to do REST    get hot and heavy fast. What are the advantages and disadvantages of REST? Who's    doing REST right and who's doing it wrong? We'll cut through the chaff, and show    you how you can use REST in your web services.</p>
