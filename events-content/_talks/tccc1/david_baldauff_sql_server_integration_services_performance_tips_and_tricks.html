<p>    High Performance SSIS data transformations are within your reach if you have the    right know-how to do the job. In this presentation we will discuss how to best use    SSIS to create high performance ETL processes. Documentation on SSIS performance    considerations is not easy to come by, so in this presentation we will go through    the major issues that you need to be aware of and plan for when high performance    is a must. We will look at the actual performance differences using varying SSIS    data transformations and other SSIS settings. You will come away with numerous techniques    which will allow you to implement fast high volume data transformations.</p>
