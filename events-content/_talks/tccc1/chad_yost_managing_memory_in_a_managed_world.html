<p>    <a href="ChadYost.zip">Content</a></p><p>    Managed memory is a wonderful thing. No longer having to worry about deleting pointers,    leaking memory, having enough space available, it is all taken care of for you by    the Garbage Collector. But what happens when a large amount of your data is large    enough that it needs to go into the large object heap. How do you make sure that    you are not fragmenting it so much that the next request to get data has space?    How do you make sure that these large pieces of data are not mapped into the address    space all the time, taking up valuable space in the 2GB limit?</p><p>    This presentation will focus on some specific functionality that Thomson-West implemented    to handle large legal documents (MB of XML), that can be slow to retrieve via soap    in a manner that kept them out of the large object heap. Discussion will center    on implementing a soap extension that generically parses a soap response to pull    out the large strings, pushing them to the Virtual Heap, instead of placing them    on the large object heap.</p>
