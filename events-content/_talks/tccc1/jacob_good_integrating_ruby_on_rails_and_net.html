<p>    <a href="http://www.thoughtstoblog.com/articles/2006/11/11/twin-cities-code-camp">Content</a></p><p>    The new kid on the block of web platforms is Ruby on Rails. We've heard about it,    dabbled in it, and might have considered using it in some our solutionsâ€¦ but one    of the hesitations comes from integration. How will it work with existing data?    How will it work with existing .NET applications and libraries? The answers are    out there ... and this discussion will lead you to examples on how you can do integration    (both ways) between Ruby on Rails and .Net. You'll see how you can easily invoke    / publish web services, databases, and libraries between the two. Come check out    what all the hype is about and expand your toolbox to help provide better solutions    to your problems.</p>
