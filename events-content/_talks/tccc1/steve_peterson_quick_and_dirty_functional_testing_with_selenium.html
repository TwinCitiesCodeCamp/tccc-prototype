<p>    Unit tests are passing but testers complain that the latest build is "completely    broken?" Tried implementing functional tests but you've gotten bitten by complicated,    difficult to maintain test sets? Can't convince developers to implement smoke tests?    Selenium might be for you. Selenium is a client side testing tool for web applications    that is distinguished by its approachability and ease-of-use. It supports major    browses on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Setting up and running tests is easy, and    you can see in the browser where the test is failing.</p>
