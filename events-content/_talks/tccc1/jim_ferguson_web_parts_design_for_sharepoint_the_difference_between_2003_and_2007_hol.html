<p>    Have you been tasked with SharePoint Web Part Development and don't know where to    start? Come to this session and explore the basics of web parts and of developing    a web part in SharePoint 2003. We will then take a brief look at the 2007 development    process. You will then have an opportunity to work through a hands on lab to create    various 2003 or 2007 web parts.</p>
