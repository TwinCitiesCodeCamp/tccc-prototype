<p>    <a href="RobHovland.zip">Content</a></p><p>    We will take a look at four asynchronous execution models using the ADO.Net SqlCommand's    Begin_ and End_ ExecuteReader methods available in .Net 2005. The samples will cover    Polling, WaitAll, WaitAny, and Callback methods. Attendees will also have an opportunity    to write a simple web application using one of the Wait methods.</p>
