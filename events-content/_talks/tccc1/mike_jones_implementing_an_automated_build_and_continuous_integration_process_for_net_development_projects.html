<p>    Adopting a "continuous integration" process which automates builds, unit testing,    code documentation generation, and source code analysis can dramatically improve    your .NET project team's efficiency at delivering high quality software solutions.    This session will explain what continuous integration is and will demonstrate one    approach for implementing the process. Several software utilities will be discussed    including MSBuild, NAnt, NUnit, FxCop, and CruiseControl.NET.</p>
