<p>    A list of keys, and a delegate: given a dictionary, return a Task. It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing. Yet from humble beginnings nearly four years ago, we have an open web standard for .NET that the community and Microsoft have fully embraced. From hosting with Katana or Helios to new frameworks and middleware free from the legacy of System.Web, the future of .NET web development will look much different from its past. This session will give a brief overview of OWIN and the current landscape, discuss its implications for .NET web application design, and review a real-world example of OWIN in action.</p>
