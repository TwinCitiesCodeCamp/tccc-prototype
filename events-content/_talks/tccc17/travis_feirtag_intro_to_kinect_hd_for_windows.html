<p>    Kinect HD was first available to the public when the Xbox One was released in November 22, 2013.  However it came with a special connector that did not allow the user to plug it into the PC.   So we were left wondering, when will we be able to write software for the next version of this awesome sensor?!   I am currently on the early preview program for the Kinect HD for Windows.   The Kinect HD for Windows was officially released to the public on July 15th.   However they havenâ€™t released all the features of the SDK to the public yet.  I am proud and excited to show you the great new features that come with the Kinect HD sensor.</p><p>    Besides being a full HD (1920x1080) sensor, it also allows you to track up to six people simultaneously.   Body tracking has greater detail and more points to work with.   The sensor is less susceptible to ambient lighting.   The overall programming interface has been updated to be much more efficient.   Audio filtering has been greatly enhanced to minimize noise.   You can even use the Kinect HD sensor for Windows Store Apps.</p><p>    There are many exciting possibilities for the Kinect HD sensor.  I hope you will join me as I show you what it can do for you.</p>
