<p>    What does it take to translate an application or website into other languages? Come find out as I share my research from my quest to translate my own apps. After a discussion of general translation topics we will cover implementations in many parts of the Microsoft stack, including MVC, WebForms, WebAPI, WPF, and more. Developers new to translation should find this helpful even if your specific technology is not used as an example.</p>
