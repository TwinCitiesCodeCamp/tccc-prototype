Spots will be limited as 60 minutes will allow for 12 spots through the session.</p><p>    Topic ideas:</p><ul>    <li>I often code in my underwear and it makes me more productive. The reasons are...</li>    <li>When I'm in my mothers basement, I find myself searching for my old C64. Here's the research I found into why that happens.</li>    <li>I built a robotic potato gun so that I could shoot myself in the shin. I've always wondered how it would feel. Here's my story.</li>    <li>My new startup, Guilt... is the Gilt of Products that helps with Bad Decision Making... </li></ul><p>    We'll have a laptop setup for short demos (web/app/etc) or if you can cobble together your laptop fast enough, you can use that.</p>
