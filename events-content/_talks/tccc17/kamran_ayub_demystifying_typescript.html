<p>    Have you ever tried to refactor a monstrous JavaScript application? There will be blood and tears. In this session, I'm going to demystify TypeScript and address common myths and general misconceptions I've heard when talking to fellow developers. I'll show you why TypeScript is an excellent way to organize (and maintain) application-scale JavaScript projects and why you should leverage it in your projects to make your life more productive and less stressful, something everyone can relate to. It's time to conquer your codebase.</p>
