<p>    One of the biggest topics in computing these days is cloud computing, and with the cloud often comes the question of how to efficiently store and process large quantities of data, as well as maintaining an active front-end that is consistently accessible to end-users while providing predictable performance. Many people still see the public cloud as prohibitively expensive; particularly if they are used to large on-premise servers with very fast processors and high quantities of memory per server. However; on Azure, it is more economical to "scale out" rather than "scale up". In this speech, I will discuss techniques for developing a highly scalable app for the Azure cloud, as well as minimizing the cost of hosting while maximizing performance.</p>
