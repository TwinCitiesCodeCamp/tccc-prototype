<p>    Node.js is a platform for executing JavaScript outside of a web browser. It is mostly used for high-traffic web services and where using the same language on the client and server are a benefit such as Single-Page Applications. This presentation will introduce you to Node.js, discuss when to use it (and when not to use it), and will show you the basics of writing node command line and web applications including modules and unit tests.</p>
