<p>    The open source TodoMVC project implements a Todo application using popular JavaScript MV* frameworks. Some of the implementations add support for compile to JavaScript languages, module loaders and real time backends. This presentation will demonstrate a TodoMVC implementation which adds support for the forthcoming W3C Web Cryptography API, as well as review some key cryptographic concepts and definitions.</p><p>    Instead of storing the Todo list as plaintext in localStorage, this "secure" TodoMVC implementation encrypts Todos using a password derived key. The PBKDF2 algorithm is used for the deriveKey operation, with getRandomValues generating a cryptographically random salt. The importKey method sets up usage of AES-CBC for both encrypt and decrypt operations. The final solution helps address item "A6-Sensitive Data Exposure" from the OWASP Top 10.</p><p>    With the Web Cryptography API being a recommendation in 2014, any Q&amp;A time will likely include browser implementations and limitations, and whether JavaScript cryptography adds any value.</p>
