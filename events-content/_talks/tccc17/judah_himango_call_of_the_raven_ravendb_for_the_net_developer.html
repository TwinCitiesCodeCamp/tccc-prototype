<p>    The NoSQL movement continues to pick up steam as developers discover they don't need monolithic relational databases. Sometimes, we just need to get some work done and start storing our data without worrying about tables schemas or PM &gt; Update-Database.  What's a developer to do?  RavenDB might just be the ticket. The new RavenDB sports a high-speed managed storage engine, fully transactional document store, an HTML5 tooling, and -- oh yes! -- first-class LINQ support. What more could a developer ask for, eh?</p>
