<p>    This session will walk you through how to build a modern Windows app with C# and XAML that runs on both Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. We will go over some of the decisions and trade-offs that need to be made to write the same code for multiple platforms as well as techniques to enable as much code reuse as possible. We will look at these techniques in action within the context of a simple application by looking under the hood at the code.</p>
