Azure Kinect DK and the Azure IoT AI Camera are two of the most advanced Computer Vision devices available for developers today!

Combining advanced depth sensor, spatial microphone array, video cameras with sophisticated computer vision and speech AI models, the Kinect is gives us an unparalleled tool for building cutting edge computer vision applications.

We'll specifically be diving into the Kinect's Body Tracking SDK - allowing for amazing kinematic and movement tracking. Think of the possibilities in Sports, Health and the Life Sciences fields -- as well as Games and other amazing user experiences!

Join Lance Larsen (Microsoft MVP) in looking how to start building your next computer vision application today!
