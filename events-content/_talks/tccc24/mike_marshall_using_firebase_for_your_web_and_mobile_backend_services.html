Today there are a plethora of cloud-native services and frameworks that allow you to quickly bootstrap the beck-end services of your applications.  Authentication, Storage, Database and Monitoring - just to name a few.  Firebase is a suite of services from Google that help you quickly add back-end services for your applications.  In this talk we'll cover the benefits of each of these services and give real examples of how to integrate them into web and mobile applications.  When we're done, you'll be well on your way to using Firebase to enable these features in your own applications.
