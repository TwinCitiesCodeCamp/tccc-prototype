I will show how to improve the performance of a T-SQL view or stored procedure by separating out the interaction with VarChar fields. I am going to demo three specific cases: Temp Tables, Group By and DISTINCT. Then I'll finish with some other T-SQL misconceptions including using NOLOCK. Throughout all of the demos we'll look at tools in SSMS to analyze performance.
