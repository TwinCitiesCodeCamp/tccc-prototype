In a healthy engineering culture, everyone is a part of the release process, but thatâ€™s not always the case for builds. Sometimes the developers own it. Sometimes the ops team owns it. In many organizations, no one owns it. Because of this, engineers have grown complacent with inefficient builds and even joke about how bad build times are. But it doesn't have to be that way. Now that she works for a company that focuses on build automation, Jenn realizes that many of the habits she developed as a software engineer are incredibly inefficient and can be improved with Developer Productivity Engineering.

Join in to learn these tool-agnostic steps to achieve build happiness:
* Measure your builds.
* Analyze the data to see how developers and CI systems are running builds.
* Optimize build script logic and the processes to run them.
* Iterate to maintain build builds and happy engineers.
