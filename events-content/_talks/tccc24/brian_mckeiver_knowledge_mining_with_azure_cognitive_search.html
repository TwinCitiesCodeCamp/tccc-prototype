We all know that providing a good search experience for website visitors is hard. Everyone expects it to “just” work like Google. Maybe there is a better way, maybe we fix this with a little help from AI robot friends.

Join the session to see how you can leverage Cognitive Services with Azure Search in your mobile and web apps. You will learn how to enhance and enrich search through Cognitive Service Skills like natural language processing, image analysis, and entity recognition. Don't know what those are? Well that's not a problem because you will find out.

You can expect to walk away knowing how to generate your own enrichment pipeline that leverages the power of AI to solve your search woes.
