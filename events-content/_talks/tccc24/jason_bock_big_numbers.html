Numbers. How are they stored in computer programs? How big can they get? What the largest number ever calculated in a program? What is a "big" number, anyway? In this session, I'll cover numbers galore, especially as it pertains to development. We'll talk about floating-point, arbitrary-sized integers, fast algorithms, and some truly monstrous numbers in mathematics that we have no hope of ever expressing in code.
