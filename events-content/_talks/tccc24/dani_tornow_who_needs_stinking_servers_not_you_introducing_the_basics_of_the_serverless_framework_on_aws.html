An introduction to the Serverless Framework on AWS. This will show how to use the Serverless Framework to deploy some simple API endpoints with interactions with a NoSQL database. Using Ruby, these simple "run only as needed functions" will allow you to maintain a highly available and cost affordable API because you will no longer need to maintain servers to keep your APIs available. You can rely on AWS (or maybe another cloud provider) to do that heavy lifting for you. Get an introduction with a demo on just how easy it is to get a simple API up & running, persisting data to a database, and adding a basic authorizer.
