Open source software is everywhere. Whether it was the central focus or an upstream dependency, open source software has likely been involved in the projects you work on. From individual developers to large corporations, we can all work to advance technological progress through transparency and collaboration. After establishing how open source software benefits developers both directly and indirectly, this session will focus on the breadth of ways to contribute to open source software. Wherever you are in your career, you have the opportunity to positively impact modern technology through contributions to open source software. Attendees will leave this session with an understanding of how to contribute to open source software, including:
-	Identifying projects to help
-	ReadMe.MD, Contributing.MD, and other common structures
-	Submitting fixes, documentation, and new features
-	Supporting the health of a project
