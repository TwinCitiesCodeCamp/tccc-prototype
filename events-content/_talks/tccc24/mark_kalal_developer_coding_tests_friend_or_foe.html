Love it or hate it, something that is getting more common in software engineering and developer interviews are coding tests.  They come in a variety of forms ranging from writing actual program code, to design and “whiteboard” problems.  In this session, we’ll discuss it from both the employer and employee perspectives, talk about what employers and teams are really looking for, and some strategies for putting your best foot forward.
