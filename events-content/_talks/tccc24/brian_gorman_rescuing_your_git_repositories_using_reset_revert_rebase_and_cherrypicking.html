I just pushed a commit to remote master! 
We merged two features to master but only one of them needs to go to production ASAP! 
I messed up my branch on rebase or something, and I can't figure out what happened, but I think I lost my work, can you help?  
In this session, we'll discuss the GIT commands of Reset, Revert, Rebase, and Cherry-Picking to perform surgery on our repository when the stuff hits the fan.
