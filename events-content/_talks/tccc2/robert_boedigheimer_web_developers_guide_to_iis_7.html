<p>    Effective web developers understand not only how pages are created but how they    are executed. IIS 7 has been modularized so functions can be removed or extended    as needed. Learn how to extend IIS with ASP.NET, and how the pipelines have been    integrated which allows Forms Authentication to be applied to all files including    images, documents, and HTML files. See how to replace built in functionality like    directory browsing, and how to provide redirects that allow wildcards and work with    directory names. Discover how to trap failed requests to help troubleshoot production    problems.</p>
