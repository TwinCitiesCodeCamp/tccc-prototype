<p>    There's more to Windows Vista than Glass and Sidebar. Learn what Vista has to offer    you as the developer, what you can take advantage of to enhance your customers user    experience and how you leverage many of these new features using the tools you have    today. This presentation is more about the features in Windows Vista, how you can    leverage them and how you can interact with them using interoperability; as many    of the new features in Vista are not .NET native (such as Aero/DWM, Windows Experience    Index information, etc.). Some examples show how to "skin" the .NET 2.0 TreeView    control to look and feel like the Vista Explorer / Windows Mail applications and    modify the behavior of a WinForms menu to show and hide similar to Windows Vista    counterparts.</p>
