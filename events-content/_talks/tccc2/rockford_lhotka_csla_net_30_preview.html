<p>    Microsoft .NET 3.0 is here, and it includes WCF, WPF and WF. Learn how these technologies    are used and supported by Rocky's CSLA .NET framework. See how WCF can be a drop-in    replacement for Remoting, web services or Enterprise Services, and how you can use    business objects with WCF to build service-oriented applications. Get a look at    how to use business objects behind WPF forms to get the interactivity of Windows    Forms, and the flexibility of using markup (XAML) to design your pages. And see    how to create workflow activities using business objects, so your workflows have    all the power and capabilities offered by CSLA .NET.</p>
