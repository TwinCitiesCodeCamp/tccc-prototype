<p>    The Microsoft Patterns and Practices group created the Web Service Software Factory    (WSSF) to assist developers and architects quickly and consistently build services    which follow sound architecture principles and design patterns. WSSF helps automate    common tasks such as project layout, message design, service interface design, message    validation, and domain object/data contract translation. In this session, we will    build a simple application with WSSF (WCF version) to demonstrate its usage, strengths    and weaknesses.</p>
