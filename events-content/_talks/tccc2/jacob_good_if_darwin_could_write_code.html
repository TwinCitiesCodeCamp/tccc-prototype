<p>    Charles Darwin had an idea: that over time, species of animals adapted; evolved.    Later, in the 1950s, computer scientists thought , "Hey, why not model natural selection    on a computer?" With that, genetic algorithms were born! This talk will introduce    (softly, I promise) genetic algorithms... applications of genetic algorithms, and    hopefully some takeaway concepts and frameworks so you can try your own.</p>
