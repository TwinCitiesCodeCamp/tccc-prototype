<p>    Unit testing is a critical activity in producing quality software. Developers should    apply unit testing in parallel to the development of the software. Because unit    testing is so important, it should be easy to perform unit testing. The developer    should be able to focus on the "what" the unit tests demonstrates rather than the    "how" to demonstrate the result. There are a fairly large number of unit testing    tools that can greatly simplify the unit testing process. Many of these tools are    free. This session would include a "dash" of unit testing philosophy plus a lot    of code that demonstrates the use the "core" unit testing harnesses such as NUnit,    MbUnit, and MsTest as well as related testing tools such as NUnitForms and NUnitASP.    The session will also address the use of tools to replace dependent elements with    dummy units, stub units, and mock units. The types of units to be tested will include:    Logic, Window Forms, Web Pages, Databases, XML Files, JavaScript, and Ajax functionality.</p>
