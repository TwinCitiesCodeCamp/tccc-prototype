<p>    As we all know, the application/database relationship domain is one of the hardest,    most time consuming, and complex areas of applications. iBatis is one solution that    is filling the gap and making these relationships as painless as possible. iBatis    consists of two pieces. One which allows robust mapping between database and application    domain objects. As well as another piece that provides abstraction of the data access    layer all together. iBatis is a good greenfield development tool, however, it's    even more useful in legacy system additions and rewrites, when connecting to existing    databases where the schema can't be changed.</p>
