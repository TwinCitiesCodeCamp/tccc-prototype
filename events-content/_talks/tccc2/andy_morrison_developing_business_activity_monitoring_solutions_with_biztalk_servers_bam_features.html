<p>    Are you constantly troubleshooting business processes embedded within and between    your custom applications? Would you like to learn more about those processes so    that you can improve them and spend less time troubleshooting them? If you answered    yes to either of these questions then BizTalk's Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)    might be for you. BAM is used to instrument your processes, from both a technical    and business perspective, so that you can enhance the processes as well as alert    users and technical staff when certain conditions are reached. This session will    introduce you to BAM through presentation and coding demonstrations. The focus will    not be on BizTalk itself but rather on its BAM features which can be used from beyond    BizTalk with a single BizTalk license.</p>
