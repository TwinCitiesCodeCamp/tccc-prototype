You may have heard of WebAssembly, like myself you probably asked "why"? Why have another way of doing web? Why introduce another standard or technology? In a world of technology saturation, what good can this do? All these questions will be answered in this session. We will explore Microsoft's experimental .NET web framework using C#/Razor and HTML that runs in the browser with WebAssembly. We will uncover the capabilities and limitations. We will see this in action and debug C# code in the web dev tools, and more. Is this the next major web innovation for the developer community? I hope you join me to find out.
