Remember when setting up a login page was easy? It seems like nowadays it can take weeks to start a project--creating a signup form, a login form, a password recovery screen, and all the validation in between. And you havenâ€™t even started on security considerations yet. During this presentation, the attendees will be introduced to OpenID Connect and OAuth. They will also learn how to leverage these technologies to create more secure applications. Most importantly, they will learn how to delegate authorization and authentication so they can focus on their real work and forget about all that security stuff.
