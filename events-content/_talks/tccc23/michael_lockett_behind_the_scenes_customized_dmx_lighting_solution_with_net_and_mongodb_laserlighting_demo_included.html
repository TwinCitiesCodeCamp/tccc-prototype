Experience dynamic lighting and special effects while learning the source code that drives them.  My session demonstrates automated control of  DMX fixtures (including lasers!)  with accompanying music as we delve into the source code that that produces the magic.  Stimulate your senses while unleashing your own creative ideas as you follow my fun development journey.   Learn how integrate .NET solutions with MongoDB  (No-SQL) data collections for driving dynamic solutions.  Learn how to maximize the functionality of .NET Datagridviews, how to make your own reusable toolbox controls, and even how to tap into the graphic components of .NET.  Are you motivated to turn your coding ideas into reality?  You will be after this session!
