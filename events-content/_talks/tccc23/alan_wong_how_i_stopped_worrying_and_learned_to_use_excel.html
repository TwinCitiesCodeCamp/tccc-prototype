Say the words "Microsoft Excel" and you can get anywhere from praised reactions as a great tool, to a clockwork nightmare of spreadsheets and formulas. We will show you how to use Excel to improve your experience as a developer; learn tricks to make Excel help write code, create class properties, parse code, use it to supplement your database queries, and more. The talk is intended to provide realistic examples of common problems that developers face, and how Excel can be the right tool for the job as a software developer.
