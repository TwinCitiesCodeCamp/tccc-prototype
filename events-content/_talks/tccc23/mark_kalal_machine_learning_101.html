What do self-driving cars, email spam filters, and online recommendation offers all have in common? They all involve machine learning! It's at the forefront of analyzing and making decisions based on large amounts of data, and in this presentation, we'll introduce the basics of machine learning, talk about common applications, and walkthrough some examples and algorithms.  Demos and code examples will be in Java (using Weka), and C# (using ML.Net).
