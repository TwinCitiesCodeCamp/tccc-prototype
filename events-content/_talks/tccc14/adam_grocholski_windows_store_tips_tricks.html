<p>    Congratulations! You made it! The endless cups of coffee, the countless late nights,    the lines and lines and lines of code have put brought you to this moment. You're    ready to submit your app to the Windows 8 store. You're ready to hit submit. Wait!    Stop! Before you click that button, it might be a good idea to make sure you understand    the Windows Store certification process to make sure you don't encounter any publication    delays due to certification failures that could have been easily avoided. In this    session, you'll learn more about the end-to-end process to publish an app to the    Store, including monetization options, submission flow and best practices, and certification    tips and tricks. Even if you haven't started creating Windows Store applications    yet, this session will serve as a good foundation to help you start your journey,    and it will help you avoid many of the pitfalls that many first time developers    run into.</p>
