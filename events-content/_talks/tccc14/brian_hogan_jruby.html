<p>    Imagine mixing the easy syntax, powerful language features, and rapid development    of Ruby with the speed, power, and flexibility of the Java Virtual Machine? Ruby    and the JVM go together like chocolate and peanut butter, and you'll see some examples    in this tak. You'll see how to use Ruby to build simple command line tools that    work on all platforns, you'll learn how to make a GUI app using Ruby and SWING,    and you'll find out how to take a Ruby on Rails application, turn it into a WAR    file, and get it working on a Java web server. With JRuby, you can use the Ruby    language and tap into the rich, powerful, and stable Java ecosystem.</p>
