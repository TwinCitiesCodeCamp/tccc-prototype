<p>    Introduction to Grails. Grails is an Open Source, full stack, web application framework    for the JVM. It takes advantage of the Groovy programming language and convention    over configuration to provide a productive and stream-lined development experience.    I will live code an example grails application to show you fast and easy it can    be build web applications on the JVM. Grails has an excellent following in the Twin    Cities with companies like Bloom Health, Thompson Reuters, Target, Object Partners,    and SmartThings all using Grails and Minneapolis hosts gr8conf US which focuses    on groovy and related technologies.</p>
