<p>    This presentation seeks to eliminate that spaghettified, unmaintainable, untestable    mess that JavaScript is so famous for producing and turn it into something beautiful.    Developed after working on large teams with devs unfamiliar with JavaScript (not    to mention Backbone) and yet tasked to create with it, I will walk through the 9    tips that I've found in practice will make your BackboneJS implementation easily    maintained, easier to read, run better, and will allow you to effortlessly write    those ever-so-important unit tests. Heavy on code samples, best practices, anti    patterns, gotchyas, and random insights, this presentation is meant to serve as    a reference point for creating a beautiful Backbone implementation for apps of any    size and reduce the learning curve of BackboneJS. Prior experience working with    Backbone is recommended, but not strictly necessary.</p>
