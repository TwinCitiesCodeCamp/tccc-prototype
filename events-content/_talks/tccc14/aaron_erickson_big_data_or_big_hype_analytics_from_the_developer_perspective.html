<p>    Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you have likely read an article, seen a    talk, or read some noxious vendor's brochure hailing the coming "Big Data Revolution".    The hype has become so thick that anything that involves a database is being rebranded    "Big Data" in the same way that anything that involves the Internet has been rebranded    "Cloud".</p><p>    In this talk, we are going to separate the cool stuff from the malarkey. We will    cover:</p><ul>    <li>Big Data and Analytics - Why it Matters</li>    <li>What is a Data Scientist? - How are they different?</li>    <li>What kind of problems are solved using Analytics?</li>    <li>What are the boundaries? What kinds of things should not be called Analytics?</li>    <li>        What technologies are used? Do they involve functional programming? Hint: It isn't        just trendy Hadoop stuff...    </li>    <li>Real world examples from recent projects</li></ul><p>    By the end of this talk, you should be both:</p><ul>    <li>excited about analytics - what it can really do for you and your clients</li>    <li>        prepared to fight the battle between the hucksters who are out there rebranding        anything that remotely involves a database as big data - and the real thing that        can really drive business value    </li></ul>
