<p>    Build it and they will come, right? Right?! As developers, it’s very easy for us    to fall into the trap of building products by adding feature after feature of what    we think users or customers may want in an application. Before you know it, you’ve    amassed a large amount of technical debt in an application where very few folks    use all the features or worse, no one buys. What if there was a tool you could use    to help keep you focused, validate your idea before writing a line of code and help    save you time and money? In this session, we’ll cover the basics of the Lean Startup    process and learning how to apply it to product development through using the Validation    Board.</p>
