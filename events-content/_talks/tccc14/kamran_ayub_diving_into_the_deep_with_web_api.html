<p>    You've watched introduction videos and presentations, you've played with Web API,    and now you're considering it for a real-world project. In this session, we'll go    over multiple issues with using Web API "in the real world" including debugging,    IOC, custom routing, error handling, working with the client-side, versioning, anti-XSS    protection, async actions, authorization/authentication, and working with multiple    front-ends (Windows 8 and the web). This session is intended for those who are already    familiar with Web API, but everyone is welcome. Kamran will be using his own project    as an example, for better or worse, and would love for attendees to bring their    own experiences to the discussion. Code will be slung, questions will be raised,    and knowledge will be shared.</p>
