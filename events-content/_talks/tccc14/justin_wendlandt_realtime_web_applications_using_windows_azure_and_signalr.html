<p>    Let’s face it, devices and apps are going to become a crucial part of our everyday    life. Tickers, dashboards and real-time systems will become more ubiquitous and    stuffed full of data than we see today. The philosophy of the world wide web being    a medium for static data is almost non-existent, yet the infrastructure hasn’t changed    in years. In this talk, we will explore how Microsoft proposes to solve this issue    with SignalR, Azure Service Bus and ASP.NET MVC 3 to build a horizontally scalable    solution to a real-time internet problem.</p>
