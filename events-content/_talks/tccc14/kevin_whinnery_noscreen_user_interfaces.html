<p>    Does your application send users a text message when their order has been filled?    Can they place an order by sending you a text? Can you interactively ask a user    for pertinent information while they wait on hold for a support rep? Can you call    them back when a rep becomes available? Can a user speak with a sales person in    their browser if they have a question about a product on your web site? These are    just a few opportunities, beyond the LCD or touch screen, that you might be missing    to interface with your users. There are approximately 7 billion users on the global    telecom network. That's over twice as many as computers and smart phones combined.    Creating rich voice and SMS interfaces will allow you to reach more people and serve    your existing customers better than ever before. Twilio makes creating these "no-screen"    user interfaces incredibly easy. If you've created a web page before, you've already    got what it takes to create a phone or SMS interface with Twilio. In this session,    we will explore how and where to add telephony into an existing application using    the Twilio platform. After a high-level overview of Twilio, we will live code new    voice and SMS features into an existing web application. We'll demonstrate how developers    can receive and respond to text messages and voice calls, and how developers can    reach out to any of the ~7 billion users on the global telecom network at any time.    Finally, we will demonstrate how developers can turn any web browser, iDevice, or    Android device with a network connection into a VoIP telephone using Twilio Client.    Code examples will be primarily JavaScript and Ruby, but the core concepts will    be applicable to any server-side programming environment. No previous experience    with telecom or a particular web development framework will be assumed. Voice and    SMS are the next frontier of usability, and Twilio can help you blaze the trail.</p>
