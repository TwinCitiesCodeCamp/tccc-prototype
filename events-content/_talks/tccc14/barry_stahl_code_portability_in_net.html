<p>    Using .NET Portable Libraries and the Dependency Injection pattern we will build    an application with versions that run on 3 distinct platforms (Win8, WP8 and the    Web), with the goal of achieving the greatest possible reuse across those platforms.    The techniques we use will minimize the code we have to create without having to    resort to the source-control trickery of the past. This session will be extremely    code focused as most of it will be spent in Visual Studio, creating code.</p>
