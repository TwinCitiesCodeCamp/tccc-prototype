<p>    Mobile development used to be a niche development platform. Many of us shied away    from it due to unfamiliarity, lack of computing power, diversity of development    environments for different devices or because we scoffed at its insignificance.    Those of us who did are now behind the times. Mobile browsing will be the PRIMARY    browsing environment in the next couple of years and just about everybody has a    smart phone and/or tablet. The revolution is here and you must adapt. For the developer    that's been reluctant to make the switch, we'll be going over the low-hanging fruit    that's been developed in the last few years by people sharing your concerns that    will help you ease into the mobile development world including PhoneGap, jQuery    Mobile, mobile websites and responsive web design.</p>
