<p>    Windows 8 introduced a new programming platform called the Windows Runtime (WinRT).    This platform is designed to support the development of “modern apps”, which are    defined by being very user-centric, having quality user experience and design, and    being integrated with cloud services such as push notifications. In this session    you’ll learn the basic flow of creating a WinRT app that integrates with the Windows    8 environment, as well as leveraging the powerful features available from the Microsoft    Azure cloud platform.</p>
