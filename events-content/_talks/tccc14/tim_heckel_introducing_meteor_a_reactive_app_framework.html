<p>    Meteor is a full-stack app framework from the future. It breaks lots of rules and    puts the developer experience at the center, promising unparalleled development    speed. Bursting onto the scene in April of 2012 with an highly popular Hacker News    launch, Meteor has since been maturing at a fast clip, as the core team works hard    to vet the framework through lots of community feedback and real-world adoption.    Join us to get the lowdown on what Meteor is, what it isn't, and whether it lives    up to the hype.</p>
