<p>    So you want to write a single page app eh? I’m not going to pretend that there aren’t    lots of frameworks out there to get the job done but something about Durandal.js    feels different – it’s simple, it runs on Knockout.js for MVVM goodness and importantly    you don’t have to write much code! FluentKnockoutHelpers builds on the power of    Knockout by using .NET and the Razor view engine to create ‘ASP.NET MVC like’ statically    typed helpers for use with Knockout. Utilize static typing, intellisense and the    compiler you already have in .NET to make Knockout development easier! In this presentation    expect to learn some pros and cons of SPAs including reasons to create a SPA in    the first place. After that we’ll dive right into the code of a non-trivial SPA    utilizing Durandal.js, Knockout.js, Require.js, Razor and WebAPI.</p>
