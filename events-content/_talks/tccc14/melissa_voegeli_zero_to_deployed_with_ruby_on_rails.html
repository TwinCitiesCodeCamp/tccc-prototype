<p>    Ruby on Rails is a MVC framework for rapid website creation. I will be demoing how    to install Ruby on your machine, installing gems (library packages in Ruby), and    how to create and configure a very simple web app with Rails. The Ruby on Rails    way is "convention over configuration" so we will easily be up and running by the    end of the hour with a simple data driven web app. Once the app is ready to be published,    I will demo deploying it to a free Ruby on Rails hosting service!</p>
