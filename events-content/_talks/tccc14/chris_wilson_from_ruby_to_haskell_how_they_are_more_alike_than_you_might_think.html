<p>    This is a talk about the similarities between Ruby and Haskell. It is also an introduction    to either; though you'd have to be familiar with the other! I'll show how you can    develop code in a cycle between testing, type checking, and refactoring that's reminiscent    of the "red, green, refactor" cycle. I will give some short code examples and then    develop a more interesting small/medium example. This is a focused version of a    series of blog articles that I've written: <a href="http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2012/12/from-ruby-to-haskell-part-1-testing" target="_blank">http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2012/12/from-ruby-to-haskell-part-1-testing</a>    (only one is currently published).</p>
