<p>    No hoax, you can actually use jQuery Mobile to build responsive web designs for    desktop, mobile, and every device in between. In this session we will review each    new feature in jQuery Mobile 1.3 including responsive tables, responsive grids,    sliding panels, and more. In addition, you'll also see several new demos that I'll    be contributing to jQuery Mobile's Demo site. Lastly, we'll discuss performance    strategies, remote debugging techniques, and client-side MVC integration advantages.</p>
