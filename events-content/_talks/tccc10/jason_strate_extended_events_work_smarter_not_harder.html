<p>    There are many ways to performance monitor your SQL Server environment. In this    session we'll review Extended Events, which is one of the newer SQL Server monitoring    platforms. Learn the ins and outs of how to get detailed information on the errors    and events that occur within SQL Server and how to dig into the information. With    a few T-SQL statements, issues that could take weeks to research can be investigated    in minutes.</p>
