<p>    Manual testing of web applications is expensive and repetitive. Often the QA staff    does not have the capacity or the project schedule does not include time to do a    complete regression test of applications for each release. Often when the project    gets behind the first thing to reduce time on is testing. Using automated web testing    in Team System 2010 can eliminate much of the repetitive manual validation of web    sites. Not only can it exercise your web application, but it generates really good    reports to show to management.</p><ul>    <li>Walk through of creating a simple web test against a simple web application</li>    <li>Making sure your web test is data driven and maintainable</li>    <li>Creating custom web test plug ins using c#</li>    <li>Coded Web Tests</li>    <li>Load Testing with your web tests</li></ul>
