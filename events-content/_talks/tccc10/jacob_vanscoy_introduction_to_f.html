<p>    F# is a relatively new language from Microsoft, which enables idiomatic programming    in functional, imperative and object-oriented paradigms. With the release of Visual    Studio 2010, is now officially supported by Microsoft along side VB.NET and C#.    This talk will focus on functional programming in F# as well as units of measure,    computation expressions and metaprogramming with quotations.</p>
