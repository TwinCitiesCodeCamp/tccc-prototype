<p>    This session covers the more complex debugging scenarios in Visual Studio including    to address debugging more complex scenarios. We'll start with setting breakpoints    (absolute, conditional, and advanced). Next, we'll discuss capturing debug output    with the System.Diagnostic.Debug statement, how and when to do tracing and logging,    debugging web pages, and analyzing log files with parsing and filtering. We'll move    to debugging performance issues using timers within the code and using Visual Studio    performance analysis. Finally, we'll finish with dealing with memory leaks; what    are the typical causes and solutions, using the .NET garbage collector to hunt down    the problems, and using SOS to poke around in memory during execution.</p>
