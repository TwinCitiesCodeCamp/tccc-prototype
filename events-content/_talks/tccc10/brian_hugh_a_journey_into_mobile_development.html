<p>    A year ago, I hopped on the mobile/smartphone band wagon, by picking up a Motorola    Droid. The original/milestone Droid phone from Motorola. I've been picking up learning    about "mobile" development and what it means to business and technologist in my    limited time, juggling multiple projects. The first thing you are faced, when you    want to explore mobile development, is what platform do you want to target? Apple/IOS,    Android, Blackberry, WebOS. As a systems integrator, with a number of technologies    under my belt, the question was how to you reach more than one platform. What I    discovered, is the web based frameworks and html5 are starting to emerge. Yes, these    frameworks are still a little on the bleeding edge of things, but isn't that what    all the fun is about? Get a peek into some of the emerging frameworks in this area.    These frameworks include jQuery Mobile, Sencha, Titanium, SproutCore, PhoneGap,    Rhodes are a few of the leading/bleeding frameworks that let you target multiple    platforms. This won't be a deep dive, but will be a mid-level overview of some of    these frameworks and my journey.</p>
