<p>    The Reactive Extensions (Rx) library is a new framework from Microsoft Research    for reactive and asynchronous programming. Why should you care? Because it's the    best innovation to come to .NET since LINQ: it will simplify your code, fix memory    leaks, institute tikkun olam, and infuse your code with all kinds of techno-zen    awesomeness. You'll walk away from this talk with just enough knowledge to be dangerous.    Oh, and you'll also grok some very practical ways to improve your code using Rx.</p>
