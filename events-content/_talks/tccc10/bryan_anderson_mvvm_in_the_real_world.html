<p>    The Model-View-View Model pattern has become the de facto architecture for applications    written with WPF and Silverlight for good reason. It makes WPF and Silverlight applications    easier to write and maintain but sometimes it can be difficult to understand how    to get a task done or how the pieces all fit together. This session will go over    the guiding principles of MVVM, explore the responsibilities of each layer, and    explain the differences between MVVM and MVC. I will focus on the common problems    teams run into when developing an application and how you can solve them by understanding    the "How?" and "Why?" of MVVM as well as the "What?" you may have seen before.</p>
