<p>    Facebook, Yahoo and others have decided there is too much value in the data generated    by their users to delete it. Ever! To store and process this data they are turning    to Apache Hadoop. In this presentation we will answer the following questions. When    is Hadoop appropriate? What are people using Hadoop for? How does Hadoop fit into    our existing environment? Finally we will investigate the internals of a sample    Hadoop MapReduce job.</p>
