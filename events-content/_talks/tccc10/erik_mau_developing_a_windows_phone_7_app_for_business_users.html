<p>    Developing a native mobile app sounded cool, but looking at the developer tools    for iPhone development made me sick. The launch of WP 7 last year opened up a world    of opportunity for Microsoft developers, and we were ready to jump on the bandwagon.    This presentation will provide an overview of the application and a behind the scenes    look at the approach we took to develop the application. In addition, we will highlight    the phone controls and phone capabilities that were used as well as discuss lessons    learned along the way.</p>
