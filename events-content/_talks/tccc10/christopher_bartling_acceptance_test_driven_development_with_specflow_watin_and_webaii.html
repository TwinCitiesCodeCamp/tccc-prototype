<p>    SpecFlow is an open-source Behavior-Driven Development testing tool for .NET that    lets you write specifications using 100%-Cucumber-compatible Gherkin syntax. It    integrates with Visual Studio, providing file templates to speed your testing efforts.    It also integrates seamlessly with the Visual Studio debugger, so that you can set    breakpoints in the SpecFlow-based tests. It can be used in conjunction with WatiN,    an open-source library for automating web browsers using .NET, and WebAii, Telerik's    free testing framework for Web and Silverlight applications. This session will give    a brief overview of the tools, highlighting each tool's role in facilitating acceptance    testing. The second part of the session will demonstrate the usage of the tools    in testing real web and Silverlight applications.</p>
