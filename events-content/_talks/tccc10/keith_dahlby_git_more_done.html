<p>    You've seen the intro, you've cloned from GitHub, but you're still not convinced    Git's learning curve is worth the climb. This session aims to shed some light from    the real world on how Git is different, why the differences matter, and introduce    some features and use cases you never knew you couldn't live without. Topics covered    will include interactive rebase, interactive add, reflog, bisect and more.</p>
