Mono is an open-source    implementation of Microsoft .NET. In this session Rocky will discuss his experiences    in porting CSLA 4 to MonoDroid for Android. You'll learn what the MonoDroid development    experience feels like, how compatible it is with .NET, Silverlight, and WP7, and    what issues were overcome to get CSLA 4 working on this different platform.</p>
