<p>    Have you read about Test-Driven Development, but uncertain of how it would really    work? Would you like to see how real practitioners discuss requirements and build    tests? In this session, two developers will pair to solve a software problem using    Test-Driven development live. You will see them discuss their approach and build    their tests unscripted. Later, anyone in the audience will be invited up to continue    the Dojo and learn TDD hands on.</p>
