<p>    CSLA .NET is one of the most widely used open source development frameworks for    the .NET platform, and it has been available since before .NET shipped nearly a    decade ago. During this time Microsoft has changed .NET itself, as well as the various    UI technologies supported by .NET. And they've introduced new platforms such as    Silverlight and Windows Phone 7. More recently, CSLA .NET has been ported to the    open source mono, along with the MonoTouch and MonoDroid platforms. Join framework    creator Rockford Lhotka as he discusses the challenges involved in building, maintaining,    and evolving a large and widely used framework over a period of many years and through    all these platform changes.</p>
