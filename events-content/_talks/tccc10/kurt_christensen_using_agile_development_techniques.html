<p>    In this overly-ambitious session, Kurt Christensen will censor neither his language    nor his opinions in a feeble attempt to distill 8 years of good and bad experiences    as an agile coach into a single hour, telling you absolutely everything you need    to know to make your next project succeed in magnificent fashion, with rainbows    and flying unicorns! How's *that* for some "agile" snake oil?</p>
