<p>    The Internet is an abundant source of semantic information which can be analyzed    to make sense of abstract ideas, to discover trends of social interactions, and    to predict future outcomes. In this presentation, we will go through the concepts    of data mining and analysis along with the design aspects of creating graphical    representations. Cloud applications and social networks are a perfect resource,    and we will discuss how the web plays an important role in today's world of data    visualization.</p>
